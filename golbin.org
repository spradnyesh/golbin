     - [X] invert the model
       - as-is:
         - article contains pointer to parent comments
         - parent comments contains pointer to children comments
         - drawback:
           - article (and all comments along w/ it) are rewritten to DB when a new comment (at any level) is added
           - hence, bad write-time performance
         - benefit:
           - easy to implement and test
           - good read-time performance (since de-normalized)
       - to-be:
         - article does *not* contain pointer to comment(s)
         - comment contains id, article-id and parent-id
         - comment-id is unique across article only (different articles can have comments w/ same IDs; thus articles can *not* share comments)
         - drawback:
           - finding all comments for an article might be non-trivial, since search + sort
           - bad read-time performance (since not de-normalized)
         - benefit:
           - good write-time performance

   - summary: Writing about writing!
   - body:
<blockquote>
"[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_be,_or_not_to_be][To be, or not to be, that is the question:]]"
</blockquote>
That is the opening phrase of a soliloquy in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare][William Shakespeare]]'s play [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet][Hamlet]]. Of course, that is a very serious question, and believe me we are not going to discuss something that important. But what we are going to discuss is an interesting, if not important, question: to blog, or not to blog.

As you must have noticed, I am a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie][rookie]] blogger. So what I am going to enumerate here are my thoughts about why one should start to blog, or not; I am not going to mention benefits or drawbacks of professional blogging (like making money, etc).

If you have ever blogged, or if you think about it deeply for just a short time, you will immediately realize the following benefits:
1. Clear thinking: as a [[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/wannabe][wannabe]] blogger, you have a lot of things in your mind that you want to pen down. The problem, nay challenge, is which of those things should be before others? In fact, which ones are suitable (good topics, not unnecessarily common/general, etc) to be blogged about in the first place. Also, once you have chosen the thing that you want to start writing, you might realize that the topic wasn't big enough to make a decent blog post. Or worse still, you might find that the thing in your mind was a very vague concept and you really don't know how to put it in words. Obviously you will have to think in detail about it and from various viewpoints. As you write more and more posts, you will do this exercise repeatedly and will get a hang of thinking more and more clearly.
Starting to blog is like trying to clean up a wardrobe into which you have been dumping clothes your whole life. It's a mess. But slowly, you will remove the mess, throw away the old, torn, unnecessary clothes, clean the good ones, iron them and arrange them back neatly in the wardrobe. Needless to say, as you clear up your brain, other aspects of your life will start getting affected too.
I think this one reason itself is enough to start blogging!

2. Ideas: Once you have written a few posts, you will start looking for new ideas. Not that you have exhausted all of yours already, but because you are searching for that domain in which you are the most comfortable. You have ideas from all fields of life based on the experiences that you have had during your lifetime. But you want to write about things that are more relevant to your readers, probably related to what is happening in your society at this time, or probably about a certain technology that they are using, etc.
What is important to note here is that a lot of ideas are flowing your way, and then who knows, probably you will yourself convert some idea into something more tangible and move from being a blogger to an [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur][entrepreneur]].
<blockquote>
[[http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/147][There is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come. --Victor Hugo]]
</blockquote>

3. Reading and writing skills: Obviously to gather ideas you will have to become a voracious reader. But at the same time, as your experience grows, you will also become a smart reader -- you will learn to differentiate between good content and bad. You will make for yourself a repository of places that you will visit frequently to hunt for ideas.
Similarly, as you write more and more posts, your writing skills will improve too. You will learn to be able to break ideas into smaller digestible chunks and arrange them in a meaningful order. Also, you might already be good at writing, but might find out, like me, that what you wrote earlier is vastly different than blogging and will need to improve at it.

4. Discipline: As with anything worth doing, blogging takes a lot of discipline. It is very easy to write a few posts in the excitement of starting something new and then getting bogged down with routine tasks and not finding time to blog. This is especially true at the beginning where it is easy to convince yourself that "you were just trying it out", or "you were never serious about it anyways", or "i am not getting any benefit out of it", etc. But this is where you have to persist just long enough for it to become a [[http://www.npr.org/2012/03/05/147192599/habits-how-they-form-and-how-to-break-them][habit]] and you will feel natural about it.

5. Reach a wide audience: The Internet has literally made the world a small place; you can reach a multitude of people from different countries, cultures, races and with different thinking. If you have "comments" feature on your blog, you will be surprised, sometimes, to find comments from varied people. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there is someone on the other side of the earth who is interested in reading what i write; believe me, it was a very motivating moment.

Of course, like other things, blogging is a 2 sided coins and has drawbacks too.
1. Raw: As a newbie, you will make a lot of mistakes. One of them is that you will either open up your heart too much or too little. In the former case you might get backlashed by your visitors (which is good for your blog ;), but not for you), whereas in the latter case your users might not connect to you and will become disinterested soon.

2. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis][Analysis paralysis]]: You might spend too much time reading other content to find ideas and analyzing what to write than actually writing something. This is actually not that bad; atleast you are increasing the horizon of your knowledge. It will surely come in handy at some point in your life.

3. Frustration: This can be especially true with newbie bloggers like me, where we see no user comments for a long time and it might feel like speaking to an empty auditorium. Don't worry, try to figure out if you are doing something wrong and correct it. More importantly, be patient. Probably, the clock gears are already working in the background, but it will take some time for the hand to visibly move :)

For me, the pros outweigh the cons by a huge margin. I have started blogging and am not looking back now. I hope you will too!

   - summary: This article is about how I overcame my fear and found my own eureka moment, how i found the initial inspiration and found the joy of writing.
   - body
Getting a [[www.golb.in][website]] built was a difficult but manageable task. But where do I get the content from? I am no writer myself. I have written a few blog [[blog.spradnyesh.org][posts]], but those were long ago and there was definitely no discipline there. Those were some random, and more importantly, sporadic thoughts that I penned down. However what I am trying to do now is a totally different beast. Of course, the idea is to attract people to write on this website, but before that there needs to be atleast some initial content. It is easier to add content and ideas to an existing work, but very difficult to start something oneself. So that is the responsibility I must take onto myself, to initiate and to lay down some basic foundation.

Ok, so now I have got myself a goal and some determination too. But that does not solve the problem of skill. Having a goal and determination does not make me a writer. So I do the only thing that makes sense, procrastinate! After having delayed the task for a few weeks, I decided to do the inevitable:

The best way to get started is to get started. --Anonymous
</quote>

The first thing that I needed to do was get over [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia][inertia]]; I needed to get rid of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_rolling_stone_gathers_no_moss][moss]], get the stone rolling. I started to think about what I should write. That's when I remembered a sentence from one of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purushottam_Laxman_Deshpande][P. L. Deshpande]]'s essays 'Majhe Poshtk Jeevan':

<quote>
Shevati kaay ho, apan sagle jana aahot na, te pattyatlya navache dhani. Majkuracha maalak niralach asto.
</quote>

Literally translated, it means "Finally, we all are just the owners of the name on the address. The owner of the content is someone completely different."

I have always been fascinated with quotations. I have a collection of quotations and phrases, not only from great people, but also anonymous, and even short sentences that I have found very interesting; anything that I have read or heard from anywhere. The most interesting thing that i find about quotations or phrases is that they are open to interpretations. The same sentence can mean different things to different people. Actually, it can mean different things to the same person when read at different times, in different moods, in different circumstances. I think that more important than the sentence is its interpretation; what one gets or understands, what one perceives from it.

For me, in the context of writing my first article on [[www.golb.in][Golbin]], the above sentence meant a lot:
1. I am the author, but what i write is consciously or sub-consciously told to me by _the_ author himself
2. This takes away some pressure from my mind about how will the article be received by the audience
3. I realize that this is only my first attempt; with practice and perseverance I am only going to improve

This is my [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_effect][eureka]] moment! I now understand what is actually meant by inspiration and it culminates in the following [[http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison][quote]]:

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein][Albert Einstein]] once said <quote>Use the brain to process (think), not to store (remember).</quote> Frankly, I don't know if [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein][Einstein]] really said that, but I know that [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studs_Terkel][Studs Terkel]] said <quote>I like quoting Einstein. Know why? Because nobody dares contradict you.</quote> ;) Anyways, the point I am trying to make is about forgetting. I think "forget" is a very important part in the preaching "forgive and forget" because forgiveness, although ideal and saintly, is extremely hard to practice, especially equally and towards all. But it is easy to forget. Actually, it is difficult, nay, impossible, to remember. Now that seems like a bold, very bold, claim. But hang on, and I will explain it shortly.

http://img.diytrade.com/cdimg/845903/7734917/0/1230259307.jpg @ http://xingfei169.diytrade.com/sdp/845903/4/pd-4400116/4969664.html
Lets start by understanding what our memory is like, and how does the process of remembering really work. For a long time it was believed that the memory is like a file cabinet, or a computer hard disk (for the geeks among you). When a memory is created, it is like a file is written and stored in a drawer or a folder. Later, when you remember the memory, it is like retrieving the file and reading the contents off of it. There is absolutely no difference between what is written in the file and what is later read from it, no matter how many times. Of course, one might forget which drawer or folder the file was kept in, and he won't be able to remember that memory; but the memory itself is very much still there.

However, studies have found that the above analogy is wrong, very wrong! The brain does not function this way. To understand memory, we have to understand the structure of the brain. The brain is made up of a lot of cells called [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron/][neuron]]s which are connected to each other via protein chains or links. It is these neurons and the links that make up memories. Let us map this understanding of the brain structure to a memory. A memory is really an event in our past that consists of items (for lack of a better word) like:
1. living things like people, animals, plants, etc
2. inanimate objects like buildings, cars, lamp posts, furniture, etc
3. location, weather, etc
4. conversations, emotions, etc
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Neuron_Hand-tuned.svg/400px-Neuron_Hand-tuned.svg.png @ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron/
Each of these items are stored in neurons and creation of a memory is like creating links or bridges between these neuron cells. Thus memory is inherently associative in nature, and the act of creating a memory is actually creating these associations.

Remembering is the process of scanning these neurons and associations between them. It is a highly imperfect process. It is very much possible that during remembering some of the neurons might not fire, that is, we might miss out on some associations. It is also possible, that some other neurons might fire, which means that we may remember (actually, imagine) something that never happened, or wasn't present, in the particular memory that we're remembering. Thus remembering is a highly creative process; we are, astonishingly, (re-)creating the memory!

Now we know that a memory has a physical presence in the brain; in the form of protein bridges between neurons. We also know that the process of creation and retrieval of a memory is not static, like that of a file cabinet or a computer hard drive, but a very dynamic one. Good! But what are it's implications? That is the next question that naturally comes to mind. Lets find out.

http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NzcwODg3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTEwOTMyMw@@._V1._SY317_.jpg @ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/
Selective deletion [[http://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/02/ff_forgettingpill/all/][{1}]] [[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id%3Dtotaling-recall][{2}]] [[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2206291/The-fear-factor-Researchers-discovery-technique-erase-short-newly-formed-memories.html][{3}]] [[http://discovermagazine.com/2008/jan/how-to-erase-a-single-memory/][{4}]]: There is a drug called [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisomycin][Anisomycin]] that prevents the creation of the linkage protein. This drug can be used to prevent a memory from being created if administered at the moment when the memory is being formed. However, it can also be used to delete a memory when it is being remembered. This is used clinically to treat [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder][post traumatic stress disorder]] or [[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/index.shtml][PTSD]]. A very good movie [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/][Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind]] was made using this concept. It also gives us some clues about why [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia][amnesia]] happens. And of course who would not remember about the movie [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/][Memento]] when we talk about amnesia? The scariest and most mysterious case about amnesia is about [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Wearing][Clive Wearing]] [[http://www.brainathlete.com/cold-sore-virus-led-severe-amnesia/][{1}]] [[http://www.human-memory.net/disorders_retrograde.html][{2}]] [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DWmzU47i2xgw][{3}]] who cannot remember anything for more than a few moments. Every moment for him is as if he has woken up from a long night's sleep, except that this night has been going on for every moment of more than the last 2 decades.

Of course, "selective deletion" of memory screams for ethics [[http://www.livescience.com/15621-memory-altering-drugs-debate.html][{1}]] [[http://www.salon.com/2011/12/31/should_we_erase_painful_memories/][{2}]]. Is it ethical to delete a memory from a person's brain? As always, this coin has 2 sides too:
1. No
   1. A memory is a very private and personal part of who one is. It is like stealing, forever, a part of your body!
   2. Every person is a sum total of his experiences, his memories. Without memories, he is not what he is!
   3. It can be used for criminal activities.
2. Yes
   1. A memory is not static thing that is stored (created) and retrieved (remembered) with the exact same content every time. It is a process of re-creation; it is the most recent recollection of what is true. This means that it changes slightly every time you remember it; it becomes more about you (your perception/interpretation of the event) than about the event itself.
   2. It can be used for treatment and giving a new life to patients.

http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMzY3NjcxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI5OTM0Mw@@._V1._SY317_.jpg @ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/
The fact that memory is not static, but gets re-created anew, modified slightly, each time, has huge implications.
1. Implanting false memories: I know you are thinking about the movie [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/][Inception]]. And thinking that this guy is surely kidding. But believe me, I am not. It is not only possible, but relatively easy to do. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Loftus][Dr. Elizabeth Loftus]] and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Sacks][Dr. Oliver Sacks]] have done a lot of ground breaking research on this subject. The reason it is easy to achieve is because of the fact that it is very much possible for some unrelated neurons to fire, just as it is possible for some related neurons to not fire.
2. This also means that nothing you remember, or worse still, know, is provably true. Watch the excellent [[http://www.ted.com][Ted talk]] [[http://www.ted.com/talks/scott_fraser_the_problem_with_eyewitness_testimony.html]["Scott Fraser: Why eyewitnesses get it wrong"]] on this subject to know how this can have huge, even legal, implications: <quote>All our memories are reconstructed memories. They are the product of what we originally experienced and everything that's happened afterwards. --[[http://www.ted.com/speakers/scott_fraser.html][Scott Fraser]]</quote>.

Finally I would like to end with an awesome short essay by the Romanian essayist [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Codrescu][Andrei Codrescu]] from the book [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101_Damnations_(book)][101 Damnations]]

<quote>The other day a friend of mine was explaining how she had to move these pixels around her computer and had to add 20 megabytes of memory to handle the operation. I had the disquieting thought that all this memory she was adding had to come from somewhere. Maybe it was coming from me because I couldn't remember a thing that day. And then it became blindingly obvious: All the memory that everybody keeps adding comes from people. Nobody can remember a damn thing. Every time someone adds memory to their machine, thousands of people forget everything they knew. Americans are singularly devoid of memory these days. We don't remember where we came from, who raised us, when our wars use to be, what happened last year, last month, or even last week. School children remember practically nothing. I take the greyhound bus every week, and I swear people on there don't know where they got on or where they're supposed to get off. They explanation is simple: computer companies are stealing human memory to stuff their hard drives. Greyhound I believe has some kind of contract with IBM to steal the memory of everybody riding the bus. They're probably connected by a cable or something. Every hundred miles, poof! Another 500 megabytes get sucked out of the passengers' brains. The computer's thirst for memory is bottomless: the more they suck, the more they need. Eventually, we'll be walking around with a glazed look in our eyes, trying to figure out who it is we live with. And then we'll forget our names and addresses and we'll just be milling around trying to remember them. The only thing visible about us will be these cables sticking out of our behinds, feeding the scraps of our memory to computer central, somewhere in Oblivion, USA. I think it's time for all these memory sucking companies to start some kind of system to feel and shelter us when we forget how to eat, walk, and sleep.</quote>

   - summary:
   - body
I'm sure you have wondered, at some time or the other, "who am i?" Probably, you are the kind of person who has meditated over it, or you might be the kind who does not give it a second thought. Probably you were born in a culture, like the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_India][Indian culture]], where you have heard this question from your elders, or from stories in your childhood. Probably you have gone one step further and wondered or heard questions like "[[http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1988/04/01][why am i here?]]" or "what am i here for?"

But have you ever wondered what does it mean to "be me"? XXX Over any period of time, be it short or long, we are continuously changing. Changing physically - children grow up, adults grow old; emotionally - our moods keep changing constantly; and in many other ways - life is change! But there is one thing that never changes, the feeling of "me". No matter where we are, in what place, in what situation, we always know our "selves". How does this happen? In fact, what is this self?

These questions can be looked at from both a philosophical as well as a scientific point of view. Today we are going to look at it from the scientific angle and delve further into questions like "what is consciousness?", "what does it mean to say 'i am me'?", "where does this consciousness come from?", "can we point to a point or location in the brain which generates consciousness?", and the like.

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/NICO_looks_at_himself.jpg/640px-NICO_looks_at_himself.jpg @ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test
Lets start with the question of "Do other creatures, have a sense of self?" It appears that there are a few animals and birds that do have a recognition of self. It has been found that they can identify themselves and know the self from the others. It is very interesting to know how scientists figure out whether animals, or birds, can identify themselves. In fact, it's a simple but very clever trick; it's called the "[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test][mirror test]]" developed by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_G._Gallup][Dr. Gordon Gallup]] while doing some [[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/167/3914/86][studies]]. XXX Consciousness, or self, is a very intellectual thing. In the mirror test, the animal is able to create a representation of itself that floats free of its body. It can't touch it or smell it, but just by seeing it, it knows that "that's me". This is very fascinating!

http://www.montclair.edu/academy/images/juliankeenan82911.jpg @ http://www.montclair.edu/academy/fellows/fellowsmentors20112012.html
[[http://www.montclair.edu/profilepages/view_profile.php?username%3Dkeenanj][Professor Julian Keenan]] has been able to pinpoint the location of where the idea of the self is generated in our brains. He created an [[http://mentalhealth.about.com/library/sci/0201/blbeth0201.htm][experiment]] using some morphing software and images of famous people like Albert Einstein and Bill Clinton to [[http://ttbook.org/book/transcript/transcript-you-your-brain][find]] out that if you <quote> press your thumb to the bridge of your nose. Now draw it slowly over the crown of your head to about where you might have a ponytail. That area under your skull is where 'you' are.</quote>

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilayanur_S._Ramachandran][Professor V. S. Ramachandran]], a world renowned neurologist, says that "self is the activities of the neurons." Although, simple when stated that way, it is, he says, one of the greatest realization in the last 100 years. He explains how the human brain is different from that of other animals. A worm, for example, does not have a brain big enough to form any sort of images in its mind. A monkey, on the other hand, although able to form images, cannot manipulate them in his mind. A human being, however, has a much more powerful brain. Only man can take images from the real world, pull them into his head, divide them into parts and then start turning those parts into abstractions, or tokens. He can manipulate these tokens and juxtapose them in counterintuitive ways; he can create even outlandish scenarios - what we call imagination. We are not different from other animals, we are only more than them. XXX We are imagining so often and so thoroughly, that we can eventually imagine ourselves! He says, self is the ability of humans to spin a story around themselves. We can take experiences, memories of good and bad events, and abstract a story out of it - that is self!

Readers of classic novels are not unaware of "[[http://www.amazon.com/Strange-Jekyll-Dover-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486266885][The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]" by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson][Robert Louis Stevenson]]. He said that he used to dream of "[[http://blog.beliefnet.com/dreamgates/2011/07/robert-louis-stevenson-and-his-dream-helpers.html][little people]]" who helped him write his stories. He trained himself to remember his dreams and to dream plots for his books. Dreams bring us to a very interesting question about consciousness. If we think about this in modern terms, like when you see a movie, you, the viewer, has no idea what is going to happen next. You scream at the scary parts, laugh at the jokes, and cry during the sad scenes. But in order for you to have that experience, someone needed to write the movie, someone needed to direct it, someone other than you. How is it, when we dream, that we do all 3 at the same time? We write, direct and watch the film as if we've never seen it before.

This is how [[http://www.wnyc.org/people/jad-abumrad/][Jad Abumrad]] and [[http://www.wnyc.org/people/robert-krulwich/][Robert Krulwich]] of [[http://www.radiolab.org/][Radiolab]], in their episode "[[http://www.radiolab.org/2007/may/07/][Who Am I?]]" find it:
<quote>
If you look scientifically into a brain, what you encounter is hundreds of thousands of players, not just little people, but teeny teeny teeny teeny brain cells which do others fashion back and forth. If you would go to any one of the cells and say, "so, are you the author of 'Jackyl and Hyde'?", the cell would just go on or off. It is only in the group that you can see the electrical outline of a thought, or ultimately of a self. While you think of yourself as a 'one', even the thought, 'I am a one', springs from a 100 million cells connecting through a trillion synapses and that all of this multiple activities, paradoxically, creates the you of this moment. You are always plural!
</quote>

There is also a medical side to our consciousness. There is a condition of the brain called [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm][cerebral aneurysm]] in which the person loses his sense of self; he becomes a completely different person. Writer and producer Hannah Palin writes about her experience when her mother suffered from aneurysm in "[[http://www.transom.org/shows/2004/200403_head_explode.html][The day my mother's head exploded]]". I like the following paragraph from the passage a lot:
<quote>
But then those moments pass and you're consumed by the trivia of daily life once again. Sometimes, when i'm overwhelmed by making my way through the world, i try to focus on the fact that the electric bill does not matter. The idiot driver glued to his cellphone, does not matter. The mind numbing day job, truly, does not matter. But welcoming the strange and the different, being open and available for my husband, my friends, my family, experiencing love and laughter as often as possible -- that's what matters. Because it can all be taken away in one brilliant flash.

   - summary: Feedback from my wife takes me onto a journey to discover the different styles of writing.
   - body:
As a birthday gift to my wife, I released this [[http://www.golb.in/][website]] on her birthday and uploaded the articles that I had written already. I asked my wife to read them and give me feedback. Personally, I would have rated them in the order of:
     1. What makes you, you?
     2. Forgetting "forgive and forget"
     3. Discovering the joy of writing
But to my utter surprise, she rated them as:
     1. Discovering the joy of writing
     2. Forgetting "forgive and forget"
     3. What makes you, you?
[[http://www.golb.in/discovering-the-joy-of-writing-1.html][Discovering the joy of writing]] was my first article and I had written it without a very clear mind and without much purpose. For the other 2 articles, on the other hand, I had done quite some research and had taken sufficient time to write and rewrite them. How was it, then, that my wife liked [[http://www.golb.in/discovering-the-joy-of-writing-1.html][Discovering the joy of writing]] the most? I asked her and she told me that she liked writings (articles, novels, etc) that talked to her. [[http://www.golb.in/discovering-the-joy-of-writing-1.html][Discovering the joy of writing]] did just that. [[http://www.golb.in/forgetting-forgive-and-forget-2.html][Forgetting "forgive and forget"]] and [[http://www.golb.in/what-makes-you-you-3.html][What makes you, you?]], however, are, what she calls, gyaan sessions, i.e. "boring".

I thought, that if I am to write, I should understand the different styles of writing. And I am not talking here about grammar, but the different genres, if you will, of writing. I thought about it a lot and the following are the different styles that I could recognize:
     - Imagination: Novels, poems fall into this category.
     - Reporting: This is mostly laying down the facts about an event or incident.
     - Contemplation: In this style, the writer has thought over and pondered about something and is writing his learnings about that topic.
     - Share: Sometimes you find out something interesting or clever, most probably in your domain of work, and you want to share it with your friends and/or the community at large. You also want to note it down somewhere where it is easy to find it later if you need. Many people use personal blogs to accomplish this.

I am sure there will be many more styles. But these are the ones that I could think of. While enumerating them, I also realized that there are multiple axes across which writing styles could be calibrated. I can think about only two right now: the one above, and the "talking" versus "boring" that started this whole train of thought. However, I think that some combinations are more compatible with each other than others. For example, "Imagination" goes well with "talking", whereas "Reporting" goes well with "boring" ;)

Of course, as a budding writer, I have to realize that I cannot be good at all styles, and neither do all people like to read all styles. So it is not possible to please everyone, and that is OK. What I have to do is to try my hands at various styles, figure out what I am most comfortable at, get feedback, and improve!

So to start off, I thought of doing an experiment. I decided to write this article in the "talk" style that my wife had told me earlier. It seems to be on the "contemplation" point on the other axis. Through this experiment, I want to find out whether I have the ability or knack of writing in this style and also see what are the views and opinions of my readers. It is for this reason that you will find no links pointing out to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page][wikipedia]] or other sites from this article. It is all my thoughts, and my thoughts only :)

Fortunately, I think that I have figured out the key to success. It's "curiosity". It is the one thing that cuts across all barriers and all axes. It is curiosity, of any form, and in any domain, that makes us humans. I am sure, you must be curious that where I have used the curiosity factor in this article. Guess? Well, it is the "title" of this article: "writing flavors". Did you not think that flavors are associated with taste, not writing. You must have guessed that this article would either be about some recipe or about writing recipes on blogs or somewhere. But then the summary of the article should tell you that that is not the case. So now you want to know, what the article is really about, and that is what brought you till here!

So what do you think? Does this flavor suit me well?
