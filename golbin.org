     - [X] invert the model
       - as-is:
         - article contains pointer to parent comments
         - parent comments contains pointer to children comments
         - drawback:
           - article (and all comments along w/ it) are rewritten to DB when a new comment (at any level) is added
           - hence, bad write-time performance
         - benefit:
           - easy to implement and test
           - good read-time performance (since de-normalized)
       - to-be:
         - article does *not* contain pointer to comment(s)
         - comment contains id, article-id and parent-id
         - comment-id is unique across article only (different articles can have comments w/ same IDs; thus articles can *not* share comments)
         - drawback:
           - finding all comments for an article might be non-trivial, since search + sort
           - bad read-time performance (since not de-normalized)
         - benefit:

   - summary: Today I have learned more git techniques than in the past few months!
   - body:
As always, [[http://www.git-scm.com/][git]] rocks! I have been using git for all my personal projects for at-least the last 2 years now. But what I have learned in this week is probably more than what I have learned in the last few months, and I am dying to share them with you!

So here goes, in the order in which I stumbled upon them:
1. git-bundle: Honestly, I learned this maybe in the last month, or the month before that. But then, I wasn't blogging actively at that time. So what the heck? I will share it with you as if I have learned it in this week ;)

Anyways, coming to the real issue that "git-bundle" solves. I work in a jail environment; well not really, but what's the fun in something if there is not even a little hint of exaggeration? The point is that we are not allowed access to git hosting sites like [[https://github.com/][github]], [[https://bitbucket.org/][bitbucket]], etc. So I was having trouble moving my personal projects (that I work on during my free/slack (see my article "don't break the chain" to see how to make productive use of slack time) time between home and office without access to a central repository to sync between my home and office repositories. I searched for other github-like sites (even paid) that I might have access to from my jail, but without success. I was very frustrated.

And then, instead of looking outward, I looked inward (wow, that came out very philosophical!). That is, instead of finding websites that could help me, I searched for whether git has any functionality that could liberate me. And voila, the thing that I found "git-bundle" was exactly what I was searching for.

That's enough of history. Lets get to the details of how git-bundle helped me. For explaining the situation however, we need to set up some environment. Let's say the 2 repositories (home and office, in my case) that we want to keep in sync are A and B. We will cover 2 cases. case-1 is where we have created a new repository (A), and where B has not been setup yet. case-2 is where both A and B exist already (say before access to github was removed), and you have now made changes to one of them, say A. Lets start with the 1st case first:

Perform the following steps at A:
1. cd <repo>
2. git bundle create <repo-name>.bdl master
3. git tag -f "bdl" master

Note that the ".bdl" extension is completely arbitrary, and git does not put any restrictions on it. Similarly you can decide on what tag you want to use. Tagging is useful when sending incremental patches (case12), as we will show below.

Back to case-1. Transfer the <repo-name>.bdl file to B (via email, etc) and perform the following steps at B:
1. git clone -b master <repo-name>.bdl <repo>
2. git tag -f "bdl" master

Once the initial setup is done, we simplify our life to be the same as case-2, that is incremental sync. For this case, lets assume that you have made some changes in B and want to move them to A. Perform the following steps at B:
1. git bundle create <repo-name>-<date>.bdl bdl..master
2. git tag -f "bdl" master

Again, the <repo-name>-<date>.bdl filename is completely arbitrary. I like putting the date part in there because that helps me avoid confusion when I am emailing multiple bundles everyday between my office and home. The part where we say "bdl..master" is the "tagging" part that i had mentioned earlier. Basically, what this tells git-bundle is to bundle only those commits that happened between when we had cloned (or "pull"-ed as explained below) earlier and where the HEAD of the master branch is now.

Then, we move the bundle file from B to A, and perform the following steps at A:
1. git pull <repo-name>-<date>.bdl master:master
2. git tag -f "bdl" master

The steps are exactly the same when you want to sync from B to A. Now, lather, rinse, repeat!

   - summary: This article is about how I overcame my fear and found my own eureka moment, how i found the initial inspiration and found the joy of writing.
   - body
Getting a [[www.golb.in][website]] built was a difficult but manageable task. But where do I get the content from? I am no writer myself. I have written a few blog [[blog.spradnyesh.org][posts]], but those were long ago and there was definitely no discipline there. Those were some random, and more importantly, sporadic thoughts that I penned down. However what I am trying to do now is a totally different beast. Of course, the idea is to attract people to write on this website, but before that there needs to be atleast some initial content. It is easier to add content and ideas to an existing work, but very difficult to start something oneself. So that is the responsibility I must take onto myself, to initiate and to lay down some basic foundation.

Ok, so now I have got myself a goal and some determination too. But that does not solve the problem of skill. Having a goal and determination does not make me a writer. So I do the only thing that makes sense, procrastinate! After having delayed the task for a few weeks, I decided to do the inevitable:

</quote>

The first thing that I needed to do was get over [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia][inertia]]; I needed to get rid of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_rolling_stone_gathers_no_moss][moss]], get the stone rolling. I started to think about what I should write. That's when I remembered a sentence from one of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purushottam_Laxman_Deshpande][P. L. Deshpande]]'s essays 'Majhe Poshtk Jeevan':

<quote>
Shevati kaay ho, apan sagle jana aahot na, te pattyatlya navache dhani. Majkuracha maalak niralach asto.
</quote>

Literally translated, it means "Finally, we all are just the owners of the name on the address. The owner of the content is someone completely different."

I have always been fascinated with quotations. I have a collection of quotations and phrases, not only from great people, but also anonymous, and even short sentences that I have found very interesting; anything that I have read or heard from anywhere. The most interesting thing that i find about quotations or phrases is that they are open to interpretations. The same sentence can mean different things to different people. Actually, it can mean different things to the same person when read at different times, in different moods, in different circumstances. I think that more important than the sentence is its interpretation; what one gets or understands, what one perceives from it.

For me, in the context of writing my first article on [[www.golb.in][Golbin]], the above sentence meant a lot:
1. I am the author, but what i write is consciously or sub-consciously told to me by _the_ author himself
2. This takes away some pressure from my mind about how will the article be received by the audience
3. I realize that this is only my first attempt; with practice and perseverance I am only going to improve

This is my [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_effect][eureka]] moment! I now understand what is actually meant by inspiration and it culminates in the following [[http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison][quote]]:

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein][Albert Einstein]] once said <quote>Use the brain to process (think), not to store (remember).</quote> Frankly, I don't know if [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein][Einstein]] really said that, but I know that [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studs_Terkel][Studs Terkel]] said <quote>I like quoting Einstein. Know why? Because nobody dares contradict you.</quote> ;) Anyways, the point I am trying to make is about forgetting. I think "forget" is a very important part in the preaching "forgive and forget" because forgiveness, although ideal and saintly, is extremely hard to practice, especially equally and towards all. But it is easy to forget. Actually, it is difficult, nay, impossible, to remember. Now that seems like a bold, very bold, claim. But hang on, and I will explain it shortly.

http://img.diytrade.com/cdimg/845903/7734917/0/1230259307.jpg @ http://xingfei169.diytrade.com/sdp/845903/4/pd-4400116/4969664.html
Lets start by understanding what our memory is like, and how does the process of remembering really work. For a long time it was believed that the memory is like a file cabinet, or a computer hard disk (for the geeks among you). When a memory is created, it is like a file is written and stored in a drawer or a folder. Later, when you remember the memory, it is like retrieving the file and reading the contents off of it. There is absolutely no difference between what is written in the file and what is later read from it, no matter how many times. Of course, one might forget which drawer or folder the file was kept in, and he won't be able to remember that memory; but the memory itself is very much still there.

However, studies have found that the above analogy is wrong, very wrong! The brain does not function this way. To understand memory, we have to understand the structure of the brain. The brain is made up of a lot of cells called [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron/][neuron]]s which are connected to each other via protein chains or links. It is these neurons and the links that make up memories. Let us map this understanding of the brain structure to a memory. A memory is really an event in our past that consists of items (for lack of a better word) like:
1. living things like people, animals, plants, etc
2. inanimate objects like buildings, cars, lamp posts, furniture, etc
3. location, weather, etc
4. conversations, emotions, etc
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Neuron_Hand-tuned.svg/400px-Neuron_Hand-tuned.svg.png @ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron/
Each of these items are stored in neurons and creation of a memory is like creating links or bridges between these neuron cells. Thus memory is inherently associative in nature, and the act of creating a memory is actually creating these associations.

Remembering is the process of scanning these neurons and associations between them. It is a highly imperfect process. It is very much possible that during remembering some of the neurons might not fire, that is, we might miss out on some associations. It is also possible, that some other neurons might fire, which means that we may remember (actually, imagine) something that never happened, or wasn't present, in the particular memory that we're remembering. Thus remembering is a highly creative process; we are, astonishingly, (re-)creating the memory!

Now we know that a memory has a physical presence in the brain; in the form of protein bridges between neurons. We also know that the process of creation and retrieval of a memory is not static, like that of a file cabinet or a computer hard drive, but a very dynamic one. Good! But what are it's implications? That is the next question that naturally comes to mind. Lets find out.

http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NzcwODg3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTEwOTMyMw@@._V1._SY317_.jpg @ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/
Selective deletion [[http://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/02/ff_forgettingpill/all/][{1}]] [[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id%3Dtotaling-recall][{2}]] [[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2206291/The-fear-factor-Researchers-discovery-technique-erase-short-newly-formed-memories.html][{3}]] [[http://discovermagazine.com/2008/jan/how-to-erase-a-single-memory/][{4}]]: There is a drug called [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisomycin][Anisomycin]] that prevents the creation of the linkage protein. This drug can be used to prevent a memory from being created if administered at the moment when the memory is being formed. However, it can also be used to delete a memory when it is being remembered. This is used clinically to treat [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder][post traumatic stress disorder]] or [[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/index.shtml][PTSD]]. A very good movie [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/][Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind]] was made using this concept. It also gives us some clues about why [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia][amnesia]] happens. And of course who would not remember about the movie [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/][Memento]] when we talk about amnesia? The scariest and most mysterious case about amnesia is about [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Wearing][Clive Wearing]] [[http://www.brainathlete.com/cold-sore-virus-led-severe-amnesia/][{1}]] [[http://www.human-memory.net/disorders_retrograde.html][{2}]] [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DWmzU47i2xgw][{3}]] who cannot remember anything for more than a few moments. Every moment for him is as if he has woken up from a long night's sleep, except that this night has been going on for every moment of more than the last 2 decades.

Of course, "selective deletion" of memory screams for ethics [[http://www.livescience.com/15621-memory-altering-drugs-debate.html][{1}]] [[http://www.salon.com/2011/12/31/should_we_erase_painful_memories/][{2}]]. Is it ethical to delete a memory from a person's brain? As always, this coin has 2 sides too:
1. No
   1. A memory is a very private and personal part of who one is. It is like stealing, forever, a part of your body!
   2. Every person is a sum total of his experiences, his memories. Without memories, he is not what he is!
   3. It can be used for criminal activities.
2. Yes
   1. A memory is not static thing that is stored (created) and retrieved (remembered) with the exact same content every time. It is a process of re-creation; it is the most recent recollection of what is true. This means that it changes slightly every time you remember it; it becomes more about you (your perception/interpretation of the event) than about the event itself.
   2. It can be used for treatment and giving a new life to patients.

http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMzY3NjcxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI5OTM0Mw@@._V1._SY317_.jpg @ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/
The fact that memory is not static, but gets re-created anew, modified slightly, each time, has huge implications.
1. Implanting false memories: I know you are thinking about the movie [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/][Inception]]. And thinking that this guy is surely kidding. But believe me, I am not. It is not only possible, but relatively easy to do. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Loftus][Dr. Elizabeth Loftus]] and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Sacks][Dr. Oliver Sacks]] have done a lot of ground breaking research on this subject. The reason it is easy to achieve is because of the fact that it is very much possible for some unrelated neurons to fire, just as it is possible for some related neurons to not fire.
2. This also means that nothing you remember, or worse still, know, is provably true. Watch the excellent [[http://www.ted.com][Ted talk]] [[http://www.ted.com/talks/scott_fraser_the_problem_with_eyewitness_testimony.html]["Scott Fraser: Why eyewitnesses get it wrong"]] on this subject to know how this can have huge, even legal, implications: <quote>All our memories are reconstructed memories. They are the product of what we originally experienced and everything that's happened afterwards. --[[http://www.ted.com/speakers/scott_fraser.html][Scott Fraser]]</quote>.

Finally I would like to end with an awesome short essay by the Romanian essayist [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Codrescu][Andrei Codrescu]] from the book [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101_Damnations_(book)][101 Damnations]]

<quote>The other day a friend of mine was explaining how she had to move these pixels around her computer and had to add 20 megabytes of memory to handle the operation. I had the disquieting thought that all this memory she was adding had to come from somewhere. Maybe it was coming from me because I couldn't remember a thing that day. And then it became blindingly obvious: All the memory that everybody keeps adding comes from people. Nobody can remember a damn thing. Every time someone adds memory to their machine, thousands of people forget everything they knew. Americans are singularly devoid of memory these days. We don't remember where we came from, who raised us, when our wars use to be, what happened last year, last month, or even last week. School children remember practically nothing. I take the greyhound bus every week, and I swear people on there don't know where they got on or where they're supposed to get off. They explanation is simple: computer companies are stealing human memory to stuff their hard drives. Greyhound I believe has some kind of contract with IBM to steal the memory of everybody riding the bus. They're probably connected by a cable or something. Every hundred miles, poof! Another 500 megabytes get sucked out of the passengers' brains. The computer's thirst for memory is bottomless: the more they suck, the more they need. Eventually, we'll be walking around with a glazed look in our eyes, trying to figure out who it is we live with. And then we'll forget our names and addresses and we'll just be milling around trying to remember them. The only thing visible about us will be these cables sticking out of our behinds, feeding the scraps of our memory to computer central, somewhere in Oblivion, USA. I think it's time for all these memory sucking companies to start some kind of system to feel and shelter us when we forget how to eat, walk, and sleep.</quote>

   - summary:
   - body
I'm sure you have wondered, at some time or the other, "who am i?" Probably, you are the kind of person who has meditated over it, or you might be the kind who does not give it a second thought. Probably you were born in a culture, like the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_India][Indian culture]], where you have heard this question from your elders, or from stories in your childhood. Probably you have gone one step further and wondered or heard questions like "[[http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1988/04/01][why am i here?]]" or "what am i here for?"

But have you ever wondered what does it mean to "be me"? XXX Over any period of time, be it short or long, we are continuously changing. Changing physically - children grow up, adults grow old; emotionally - our moods keep changing constantly; and in many other ways - life is change! But there is one thing that never changes, the feeling of "me". No matter where we are, in what place, in what situation, we always know our "selves". How does this happen? In fact, what is this self?

These questions can be looked at from both a philosophical as well as a scientific point of view. Today we are going to look at it from the scientific angle and delve further into questions like "what is consciousness?", "what does it mean to say 'i am me'?", "where does this consciousness come from?", "can we point to a point or location in the brain which generates consciousness?", and the like.

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/NICO_looks_at_himself.jpg/640px-NICO_looks_at_himself.jpg @ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test
Lets start with the question of "Do other creatures, have a sense of self?" It appears that there are a few animals and birds that do have a recognition of self. It has been found that they can identify themselves and know the self from the others. It is very interesting to know how scientists figure out whether animals, or birds, can identify themselves. In fact, it's a simple but very clever trick; it's called the "[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test][mirror test]]" developed by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_G._Gallup][Dr. Gordon Gallup]] while doing some [[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/167/3914/86][studies]]. XXX Consciousness, or self, is a very intellectual thing. In the mirror test, the animal is able to create a representation of itself that floats free of its body. It can't touch it or smell it, but just by seeing it, it knows that "that's me". This is very fascinating!

[[http://www.montclair.edu/profilepages/view_profile.php?username%3Dkeenanj][Professor Julian Keenan]] has been able to pinpoint the location of where the idea of the self is generated in our brains. He created an [[http://mentalhealth.about.com/library/sci/0201/blbeth0201.htm][experiment]] using some morphing software and images of famous people like Albert Einstein and Bill Clinton to [[http://ttbook.org/book/transcript/transcript-you-your-brain][find]] out that if you <quote> press your thumb to the bridge of your nose.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilayanur_S._Ramachandran][Professor V. S. Ramachandran]], a world renowned neurologist, says that "self is the activities of the neurons." Although, simple when stated that way, it is, he says, one of the greatest realization in the last 100 years. He explains how the human brain is different from that of other animals. A worm, for example, does not have a brain big enough to form any sort of images in its mind. A monkey, on the other hand, although able to form images, cannot manipulate them in his mind. A human being, however, has a much more powerful brain. Only man can take images from the real world, pull them into his head, divide them into parts and then start turning those parts into abstractions, or tokens. He can manipulate these tokens and juxtapose them in counterintuitive ways; he can create even outlandish scenarios - what we call imagination. We are not different from other animals, we are only more than them. XXX We are imagining so often and so thoroughly, that we can eventually imagine ourselves! He says, self is the ability of humans to spin a story around themselves. We can take experiences, memories of good and bad events, and abstract a story out of it - that is self!

Readers of classic novels are not unaware of "[[http://www.amazon.com/Strange-Jekyll-Dover-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486266885][The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]" by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson][Robert Louis Stevenson]]. He said that he used to dream of "[[http://blog.beliefnet.com/dreamgates/2011/07/robert-louis-stevenson-and-his-dream-helpers.html][little people]]" who helped him write his stories. He trained himself to remember his dreams and to dream plots for his books. Dreams bring us to a very interesting question about consciousness. If we think about this in modern terms, like when you see a movie, you, the viewer, has no idea what is going to happen next. You scream at the scary parts, laugh at the jokes, and cry during the sad scenes. But in order for you to have that experience, someone needed to write the movie, someone needed to direct it, someone other than you. How is it, when we dream, that we do all 3 at the same time? We write, direct and watch the film as if we've never seen it before.

This is how [[http://www.wnyc.org/people/jad-abumrad/][Jad Abumrad]] and [[http://www.wnyc.org/people/robert-krulwich/][Robert Krulwich]] of [[http://www.radiolab.org/][Radiolab]], in their episode "[[http://www.radiolab.org/2007/may/07/][Who Am I?]]" find it:

If you look scientifically into a brain, what you encounter is hundreds of thousands of players, not just little people, but teeny teeny teeny teeny brain cells which do others fashion back and forth. If you would go to any one of the cells and say, "so, are you the author of 'Jackyl and Hyde'?", the cell would just go on or off. It is only in the group that you can see the electrical outline of a thought, or ultimately of a self. While you think of yourself as a 'one', even the thought, 'I am a one', springs from a 100 million cells connecting through a trillion synapses and that all of this multiple activities, paradoxically, creates the you of this moment. You are always plural!

There is also a medical side to our consciousness. There is a condition of the brain called [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm][cerebral aneurysm]] in which the person loses his sense of self; he becomes a completely different person. Writer and producer Hannah Palin writes about her experience when her mother suffered from aneurysm in "[[http://www.transom.org/shows/2004/200403_head_explode.html][The day my mother's head exploded]]". I like the following paragraph from the passage a lot:
<quote>
But then those moments pass and you're consumed by the trivia of daily life once again. Sometimes, when i'm overwhelmed by making my way through the world, i try to focus on the fact that the electric bill does not matter. The idiot driver glued to his cellphone, does not matter. The mind numbing day job, truly, does not matter. But welcoming the strange and the different, being open and available for my husband, my friends, my family, experiencing love and laughter as often as possible -- that's what matters. Because it can all be taken away in one brilliant flash.

   - summary: Feedback from my wife takes me onto a journey to discover the different styles of writing.
   - body:
As a birthday gift to my wife, I released this [[http://www.golb.in/][website]] on her birthday and uploaded the articles that I had written already. I asked my wife to read them and give me feedback. Personally, I would have rated them in the order of:
     1. What makes you, you?
     2. Forgetting "forgive and forget"
     3. Discovering the joy of writing
But to my utter surprise, she rated them as:
     1. Discovering the joy of writing
     2. Forgetting "forgive and forget"
     3. What makes you, you?
[[http://www.golb.in/discovering-the-joy-of-writing-1.html][Discovering the joy of writing]] was my first article and I had written it without a very clear mind and without much purpose. For the other 2 articles, on the other hand, I had done quite some research and had taken sufficient time to write and rewrite them. How was it, then, that my wife liked [[http://www.golb.in/discovering-the-joy-of-writing-1.html][Discovering the joy of writing]] the most? I asked her and she told me that she liked writings (articles, novels, etc) that talked to her. [[http://www.golb.in/discovering-the-joy-of-writing-1.html][Discovering the joy of writing]] did just that. [[http://www.golb.in/forgetting-forgive-and-forget-2.html][Forgetting "forgive and forget"]] and [[http://www.golb.in/what-makes-you-you-3.html][What makes you, you?]], however, are, what she calls, gyaan sessions, i.e. "boring".

I thought, that if I am to write, I should understand the different styles of writing. And I am not talking here about grammar, but the different genres, if you will, of writing. I thought about it a lot and the following are the different styles that I could recognize:
     - Imagination: Novels, poems fall into this category.
     - Reporting: This is mostly laying down the facts about an event or incident.
     - Contemplation: In this style, the writer has thought over and pondered about something and is writing his learnings about that topic.
     - Share: Sometimes you find out something interesting or clever, most probably in your domain of work, and you want to share it with your friends and/or the community at large. You also want to note it down somewhere where it is easy to find it later if you need. Many people use personal blogs to accomplish this.

I am sure there will be many more styles. But these are the ones that I could think of. While enumerating them, I also realized that there are multiple axes across which writing styles could be calibrated. I can think about only two right now: the one above, and the "talking" versus "boring" that started this whole train of thought. However, I think that some combinations are more compatible with each other than others. For example, "Imagination" goes well with "talking", whereas "Reporting" goes well with "boring" ;)

Of course, as a budding writer, I have to realize that I cannot be good at all styles, and neither do all people like to read all styles. So it is not possible to please everyone, and that is OK. What I have to do is to try my hands at various styles, figure out what I am most comfortable at, get feedback, and improve!

So to start off, I thought of doing an experiment. I decided to write this article in the "talk" style that my wife had told me earlier. It seems to be on the "contemplation" point on the other axis. Through this experiment, I want to find out whether I have the ability or knack of writing in this style and also see what are the views and opinions of my readers. It is for this reason that you will find no links pointing out to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page][wikipedia]] or other sites from this article. It is all my thoughts, and my thoughts only :)

Fortunately, I think that I have figured out the key to success. It's "curiosity". It is the one thing that cuts across all barriers and all axes. It is curiosity, of any form, and in any domain, that makes us humans. I am sure, you must be curious that where I have used the curiosity factor in this article. Guess? Well, it is the "title" of this article: "writing flavors". Did you not think that flavors are associated with taste, not writing. You must have guessed that this article would either be about some recipe or about writing recipes on blogs or somewhere. But then the summary of the article should tell you that that is not the case. So now you want to know, what the article is really about, and that is what brought you till here!

So what do you think? Does this flavor suit me well?
   - notes:
     - styles
       - share a eureka moment (discovery/invention)
       - imagination (story telling)
       - reporting (event, news, etc)
       - contemplation (thoughts)
     - wife's feedback: talking v/s gyaan (so many people saying so many things)
     - success factor
       - different people like to read different flavors
       - different people have different writing styles; one can't write all
       - but try to be catchy => something that makes curious (curiosity is common to all humans)
         - eg: kinds of writing -> writing kinds -> writing flavors
       - "best selling author" not "best read author"

   - summary: Writing about writing!
   - body:
<blockquote>
"[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_be,_or_not_to_be][To be, or not to be, that is the question:]]"
</blockquote>
That is the opening phrase of a soliloquy in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare][William Shakespeare]]'s play [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet][Hamlet]]. Of course, that is a very serious question, and believe me we are not going to discuss something that important. But what we are going to discuss is an interesting, if not important, question: to blog, or not to blog.

As you must have noticed, I am a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie][rookie]] blogger. So what I am going to enumerate here are my thoughts about why one should start to blog, or not; I am not going to mention benefits or drawbacks of professional blogging (like making money, etc).

If you have ever blogged, or if you think about it deeply for just a short time, you will immediately realize the following benefits:
1. Clear thinking: as a [[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/wannabe][wannabe]] blogger, you have a lot of things in your mind that you want to pen down. The problem, nay challenge, is which of those things should be before others? In fact, which ones are suitable (good topics, not unnecessarily common/general, etc) to be blogged about in the first place. Also, once you have chosen the thing that you want to start writing, you might realize that the topic wasn't big enough to make a decent blog post. Or worse still, you might find that the thing in your mind was a very vague concept and you really don't know how to put it in words. Obviously you will have to think in detail about it and from various viewpoints. As you write more and more posts, you will do this exercise repeatedly and will get a hang of thinking more and more clearly.
Starting to blog is like trying to clean up a wardrobe into which you have been dumping clothes your whole life. It's a mess. But slowly, you will remove the mess, throw away the old, torn, unnecessary clothes, clean the good ones, iron them and arrange them back neatly in the wardrobe. Needless to say, as you clear up your brain, other aspects of your life will start getting affected too.
I think this one reason itself is enough to start blogging!

2. Ideas: Once you have written a few posts, you will start looking for new ideas. Not that you have exhausted all of yours already, but because you are searching for that domain in which you are the most comfortable. You have ideas from all fields of life based on the experiences that you have had during your lifetime. But you want to write about things that are more relevant to your readers, probably related to what is happening in your society at this time, or probably about a certain technology that they are using, etc.
What is important to note here is that a lot of ideas are flowing your way, and then who knows, probably you will yourself convert some idea into something more tangible and move from being a blogger to an [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur][entrepreneur]].
<blockquote>
[[http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/147][There is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come. --Victor Hugo]]
</blockquote>

3. Reading and writing skills: Obviously to gather ideas you will have to become a voracious reader. But at the same time, as your experience grows, you will also become a smart reader -- you will learn to differentiate between good content and bad. You will make for yourself a repository of places that you will visit frequently to hunt for ideas.
Similarly, as you write more and more posts, your writing skills will improve too. You will learn to be able to break ideas into smaller digestible chunks and arrange them in a meaningful order. Also, you might already be good at writing, but might find out, like me, that what you wrote earlier is vastly different than blogging and will need to improve at it.

4. Discipline: As with anything worth doing, blogging takes a lot of discipline. It is very easy to write a few posts in the excitement of starting something new and then getting bogged down with routine tasks and not finding time to blog. This is especially true at the beginning where it is easy to convince yourself that "you were just trying it out", or "you were never serious about it anyways", or "i am not getting any benefit out of it", etc. But this is where you have to persist just long enough for it to become a [[http://www.npr.org/2012/03/05/147192599/habits-how-they-form-and-how-to-break-them][habit]] and you will feel natural about it.

5. Reach a wide audience: The Internet has literally made the world a small place; you can reach a multitude of people from different countries, cultures, races and with different thinking. If you have "comments" feature on your blog, you will be surprised, sometimes, to find comments from varied people. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there is someone on the other side of the earth who is interested in reading what i write; believe me, it was a very motivating moment.

Of course, like other things, blogging is a 2 sided coins and has drawbacks too.
1. Raw: As a newbie, you will make a lot of mistakes. One of them is that you will either open up your heart too much or too little. In the former case you might get backlashed by your visitors (which is good for your blog ;), but not for you), whereas in the latter case your users might not connect to you and will become disinterested soon.

2. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis][Analysis paralysis]]: You might spend too much time reading other content to find ideas and analyzing what to write than actually writing something. This is actually not that bad; atleast you are increasing the horizon of your knowledge. It will surely come in handy at some point in your life.

3. Frustration: This can be especially true with newbie bloggers like me, where we see no user comments for a long time and it might feel like speaking to an empty auditorium. Don't worry, try to figure out if you are doing something wrong and correct it. More importantly, be patient. Probably, the clock gears are already working in the background, but it will take some time for the hand to visibly move :)

For me, the pros outweigh the cons by a huge margin. I have started blogging and am not looking back now. I hope you will too!

*** DONE virtualbox guest additions on Sabayon Linux

   - summary Steps to get virtualbox-guest-additions to work on Sabayon Linux as a guest OS
   - body
First, things keep changing continuously in the Linux world. Secondly, configurations differ, ergo YMMV ;)

With that out of the way, lets attack the main issue. Thing is, i spent a total of 6 hours trying to get virtualbox guest additions to work my Sabayon Linux guest on a WindoZZZe-7 host :((

unfortunately the [[https://wiki.sabayon.org/index.php?title%3DHOWTO:_Install_VirtualBox][Sabayon wiki]] does not help much for when Sabayon is installed as a guest

i got all sorts of errors right from guest addition features like full-screen and shared folder mounting not working to xorg crash without much helpful error logs. Anyways, long story short, i was able to solve all these problems by following the steps below

note: 1. your kernel and virtualbox version numbers might vary
2. simply installing virtualbox, pulls a new kernel, which makes things even more difficult

      1. equo install sys-kernel/sabayon-sources-3.11.2 sys-kernel/linux-sabayon-3.11.2 x11-drivers/xf86-video-virtualbox-4.2.18#3.11.2-sabayon app-emulation/virtualbox-modules-4.2.18#3.11.2-sabayon app-emulation/virtualbox-guest-additions-4.2.18#3.11.2-sabayon
      2. kernel-switcher switch linux-server-3.11.2
      3. add 'modules="vboxdrv vboxnetflt vboxnetadp vboxsf"' in /etc/conf.d/modules
      4. add user to vboxusers and vboxguest groups
      5. add virtualbox-guest-additions to default runlevel
      6. eselect opengl set ati
      7. do *NOT* do the following. basically don't use vboxvideo driver, instead use an empty xorg.conf file and things should just work fine
         1. cp /usr/share/doc/virtualbox-guest-additions-4.2.18/xorg.conf.vbox /etc/X11/xorg.conf
         2. eselect opengl set xorg-x11
         3. append 'vboxvideo' to /etc/conf.d/modules (in step-3 above)

Even after doing all above, i'm still facing some issues. I'd be grateful if someone could kindly tell me the solution, or even tell me a better/correct-er way of getting things to work:
-- shared folders work weirdly: i cannot view/enter contents of shared-folder. however, i have a soft-link to a file inside a shared folder, and i am able to read/write from/to the file without any problem. weird, huh???
-- clipboard sharing does not work

I have this (weird?) habit of collecting sentences -- quotes, proverbs, and the like. Any time i read something interesting anywhere, be it a book, blog or a magazine, or even a billboard, anything really, i note it down into my small (about 550+ lines long now) file of quotes. I also have a small program i wrote more than 5 years ago that shows me 1 line from the file everyday, and also sets it as my messenger status and email signature.

Anyways, a few days ago, i read the following quote:
[[http://www.iwise.com/tocbM][Catch a man a fish and you can sell it to him. Teach a man to fish, and you ruin a wonderful business opportunity. --Karl Marx]]
and immediately my thoughts went to the proverb:
[[Http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/2279.html][Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime. --Chinese proverb]]
There is hardly a man who does not know the above proverb.

But what struck me about these 2 quotes was that more important than a "thing", is the "point-of-view". How you view something, or what you are thinking when viewing something might completely change the appearance of that thing. This applies to not only inanimate things, but also to people. We tend to have pre-conceived notions about certain people, or group of people and label them.

     - what
       - A lucid dream is a dream in which you know you are dreaming. Typically this happens when the dreamer experiences something strange, and when they stop to question their reality, they realize they are in a dream. Lucid dreams happen naturally on occasion, although some people may have them naturally more often than others. --http://www.dreamviews.com/content/what-lucid-dreaming-16/
       - Lucid dreaming is awareness of the fact that you are dreaming. This awareness can range from very faint recognition of the fact to something as momentous as a broadening of awareness beyond what has ever been experienced even in waking life. Lucid dreams usually occur while a person is in the middle of a regular dream and suddenly realizes that they are dreaming. Once you realize this, you have the ability to control your dreams, which is pretty much the most essential part of lucid dreaming. --http://www.wikihow.com/Lucid-Dream
     - why/benefits
       - talk to subconscious: know more about yourself
       - visualize and rehearse a scenario (asking boss about raise, achieving a goal, etc)
       - greater confidence, improve creativity
     - how
       1. keep a dream journal
       2. learn the best time to have a dream
       3. try different techniques like MILD, WBTB, WILD, etc

I was listening to a [[http://www.radiolab.org/][radiolab]] episode a few days ago when I stumbled upon the words "lucid dreaming". It piqued my curiosity and I looked it up only to find very interesting things about it. So what is "lucid dreaming"? To quote [[http://www.dreamviews.com/content/what-lucid-dreaming-16/][dreamviews.com]]

A lucid dream is a dream in which you know you are dreaming. Typically this happens when the dreamer experiences something strange, and when they stop to question their reality, they realize they are in a dream. Lucid dreams happen naturally on occasion, although some people may have them naturally more often than others.

Now, why would anyone want to be aware of what dreams he's having? Well, there are some very interesting advantages:
- A dream (in which you are aware) is like talking with your subconscious. And I mean literally talk. You can ask it questions, and it will answer back. You can learn something about yourself which you never knew. Maybe find out your passions, fears, etc. Sometimes it's difficult to "really" know what you "really" like/dislike. This technique will help you find it.
- Being aware that you are dreaming makes it possible to modify a dream and even control it. This makes A dream an ideal place for visualization and rehearsal. This is very useful due to the following 2 facts
  - Because brain activity during the dream state is the same as during a real life event, what you "learn" or "practice" in your lucid dream state is similar to the training and preparation you do in the waking world.  Your neuronal patterns are already being conditioned. --http://www.dreammoods.com/dreaminformation/dreamtypes/luciddreams.htm
  - Visualization techniques are great tools for "goal achievement" (for example, see [[http://ezinearticles.com/?Visualization---How-to-Achieve-Your-Goals&id%3D8006701][here]], [[http://www.essentiallifeskills.net/visualization.html][here]], [[http://ezinearticles.com/?Visualization-Techniques---Using-the-Mind-to-Achieve-Goals&id%3D3534478][here]], [[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-niles-phd/visualization-goals_b_878424.html][here]] and [[http://voices.yahoo.com/goal-setting-visualization-techniques-263469.html][here]])

Lets come to the "how" of "lucid dreaming". There is a ton of good material out there to help you if you are interested. But here are some starting points

We have been absent from writing articles for some time now because we were working on improving the [[http://www.golb.in/][Golbin!]] experience. For both viewers and story-tellers!

So lets see what's new in [[http://www.golb.in/][Golbin!]]:
1. Load comments via [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)][ajax]]: This feature will load comments in a lazy fashion; that is, after the whole page has been loaded. Because of this, the page-load-time (as seen by search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo!, etc) will improve and give [[http://www.golb.in/][Golbin!]] a better [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization][SEO]] ranking.
2. Threaded comments: Viewers can now reply to existing comments, or add fresh new comments of their own. We hope that this will increase viewer engagement. Not only via interaction within themselves, but even the story-teller will be able to respond to particular comments and have a meaningful, relevant and easy-to-follow conversation!
3. Page backgrounds: Story-tellers can now define a custom image for all of their pages (story pages, and author page) and make their stories more beautiful and attractive for viewers. Also, this will help them distinguish themselves from other story-tellers, and portray their personality more effectively!
4. Improved editorial site timing by 100x: Last, but not least, we made some performance improvements to the editorial site. This small change alone brought the page timings down from 3 seconds to 30 milliseconds, an improvement of 100x!

That's not all. We will be adding new features, both small and big, regularly. Sometimes they will be user facing (affecting either viewers and/or story-tellers) and sometimes not. But either ways, we will keep you folks updated. See you soon, with the next set of updates!

   - summary: Fortunately, for us, the issue turned out to be a false-positive, and we got spared.
   - body:
I recently came across the following scenario in my work-place. We use [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion][SVN]] as our [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control][version control]] repository, and use a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(software)][trunk]] for production pushes and feature branch for feature development. However, this time we made the mistake of merging feature-branch into trunk-prematurely; because the client team wanted to test both trunk features/bug-fixes and feature-branch changes together before the next launch (a very valid ask).
Now the issue is that if we get an critical bug that needs to be fixed ASAP, then the trunk is no longer clean to do a bug-fix and re-deploy.
However, on the other hand, we could not have merged the trunk changes into the feature-branch, because merging back (into trunk, after feature-branch work is done and tested) would have been a nightmare. Basically we chose the easier merge (feature-branch -> trunk) now, in order to avoid the (super) messy merge (trunk -> feature-branch -> trunk) later on.
I think we faced this issue because how SVN handles merges. Basically, it takes the 2 copies of the same file at the HEAD of each branch and tries to do a intelligent merge; it does NOT take the history of the changes into consideration while merging. This causes conflicts
-- less when we do feature-branch -> trunk, because (hopefully) the same files would not have been touched in both the branches
-- but (too) many when we do trunk -> feature-branch -> trunk, because every (merge) file is touched in both branches
So how do we solve this situation? What do we do?
Enter git! In git, then branch and commit situation is extremely different (and easy). After creating a feature-branch, one should do "git rebase <trunk>" regularly to pull changes from trunk (known as "master" in git-land) into the feature-branch. This way, the conflicts, if any, will be very small and easily resolvable. Once the feature development and testing is complete, on simply does "git merge <feature-branch>".
The benefit of this approach is:
-- the feature-branch always has all trunk changes, so the client-team request can be easily fulfilled right from the feature-branch
-- final merge (feature-branch -> trunk) is super easy, because no 2 files have changed simultaneously (if they had, then these merge-conflicts have already been resolved during the "rebase" step)
I don't know how to achieve the same in SVN; atleast not easily. Please share if you do!
Fortunately, for us, the issue turned out to be a false-positive, and we got spared.
ps: Read [[http://paulhammant.com/2013/04/05/what-is-trunk-based-development/][this]], [[http://guides.beanstalkapp.com/version-control/branching-best-practices.html][this]] and [[http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.branchmerge.commonpatterns.html][this]] for more info on common branching patterns

	Now the issue is that if we get an critical bug that needs to be fixed ASAP, then the trunk is no longer clean to do a bug-fix and re-deploy.</p>
<p>
	However, on the other hand, we could not have merged the trunk changes into the feature-branch, because merging back (into trunk, after feature-branch work is done and tested) would have been a nightmare. Basically we chose the easier merge (feature-branch -&gt; trunk) now, in order to avoid the (super) messy merge (trunk -&gt; feature-branch -&gt; trunk) later on.</p>
<p>
	I think we faced this issue because how SVN handles merges. Basically, it takes the 2 copies of the same file at the HEAD of each branch and tries to do a intelligent merge; it does NOT take the history of the changes into consideration while merging. This causes conflicts</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		less when we do feature-branch -&gt; trunk, because (hopefully) the same files would not have been touched in both the branches (see part-1 of figure above)</li>
	<li>
		but (too) many when we do trunk -&gt; feature-branch -&gt; trunk, because every (merge) file is touched in both branches (see part-2 of figure above)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	So how do we solve this situation? What do we do?</p>
<p>
	Enter git! In git, then branch and commit situation is extremely different (and easy). After creating a feature-branch, one should do &quot;git rebase &lt;trunk&gt;&quot; regularly to pull changes from trunk (known as &quot;master&quot; in git-land) into the feature-branch (see parts-3, 4 and 5 of figure above). This way, the conflicts, if any, will be very small and easily resolvable. Once the feature development and testing is complete, on simply does &quot;git merge &lt;feature-branch&gt;&quot;.</p>
<p>
	The benefit of this approach is:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		the feature-branch always has all trunk changes, so the client-team request can be easily fulfilled right from the feature-branch</li>
	<li>
		final merge (feature-branch -&gt; trunk) is super easy, because no 2 files have changed simultaneously (if they had, then these merge-conflicts have already been resolved during the &quot;rebase&quot; step)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	I don&#39;t know how to achieve the same in SVN; atleast not easily. Please share if you do!</p>
<p>
	Fortunately, for us, the issue turned out to be a false-positive, and we got spared.</p>

       - merged before launch-date (because client wants to test both trunk changes and feature together)
       - production issue (should be fixed in clean (non-merged) trunk
       - how to???
     - git
       - regular "pull" (trunk -> feature)
       - test in feature
       - merge feature into trunk _during/after_ launch

   - summary: Find out how we sped up our editorial site 100x; and how you can do the same to your own!
   - body:
If you remember, we had mentioned in one of our recent posts that we increased the speed of our editorial site by 100 times. That's right, 100 times! So what is the secret? How did we do it? Well, actually there's the short answer and the long answer.

For all you impatient folks out there, the short answer first: We put extremely long processes (like sending email) into the background and returned the page without waiting for its result!

However, in reality things are not so simple. As [[http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/][Donald Knuth]] put it: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil". So we did what was correct: measure. We performed the following steps:
-- measure page speed (as perceived by end users) using tools like [[http://yslow.org/][yslow]], [[https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/][pagespeed]], etc
-- figure out which requests are taking time
-- split the above requests into frontend (network and client-side) and backend (server-side) categories (explanation of these categories is for another post ;). for now, lets concentrate only on backend issues)
-- during our measurements, we found that the article create/update page was the slowest
-- this was mainly due to activities like sending emails and submitting pages to web-archive.com took the most times. but, we realized that the user need not wait for these activities to finish. thus, by simply putting these activities into a separate thread (and not waiting for the thread to finish execution), we were able to bring down the page load time from 3 seconds to about 30 milliseconds; a whopping gain of 100x

The lessons that we learned from the above exercise were
-- don't do premature optimization
-- measure before starting to optimize
-- go for the low hanging fruits (find the thing that will give the maximum ROI)
-- don't optimize parts that will not have any impact (for eg, improving the performance of some rarely called function from 5ms to 4ms by spending 2 hours is pretty much useless)

We would like to hear about your optimization experiences!

   - summary: What is the productivity technique that works for you?
   - body:
Lately i have been having streaks of unproductive days. Days when i don't feel like doing anything. I think it's OK and normal to have a day or 2 like that, but when it becomes day"s", then one starts to worry. Work starts to pile up and frustration starts to build. Things go from normal to bad to worse. The mounting frustration does little to help getting out of this situation.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not lazy. Quite on the contrary, I'm a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done][GTD]] fan. I use [[http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/][emacs]] and the super-excellent [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] to maintain both notes and tasks. In fact, org-mode was one big reason why i gave up my "Doc-vim" status and entered the life of emacs. Anyways, that's a story for a different day ;)

Coming back on track, so here I am, in the midst of such a streak when I stumbled upon "don't break the chain" approach to productivity. Earlier i have read about (and given a try) to methods like "[[http://pomodorotechnique.com/][pomodoro technique]]", etc. But they did not work for me.

Of course, i understand and agree that pomodoro technique is more for time-management and not motivation to get out of a slack phase. It works best when i have too much work to do but I am getting distracted and/or interrupted too often. It allows me to have uninterrupted time-slots for tasks, where i should be able to focus and concentrate without any distractions.

But, we should also realize that it's not possible to be super busy 24x7. There will be times when one does not have too much work. Of course, these days are there to allow one to recuperate, regain that lost energy (from the last sprint), store some extra energy (for the next sprint). Also, these days are excellent times to learn something new and expand our knowledge base, or get involved in some hobby -- maybe something that you've wanted to do for a long time but never got the time to get started.

Good! I am in a slack period and have a lot of time. But there is no motivation. I don't feel like doing anything. I'm sure you have felt this too, at some time or the other. So what to do? Enter "[[http://lifehacker.com/5886128/how-seinfelds-productivity-secret-fixed-my-procrastination-problem][don't break the chain]]". I recently stumbled over it [[http://lifehacker.com/5939526/lift-for-iphone-keeps-you-on-track-helps-you-master-seinfelds-productivity-method][here]]. I must agree that i liked it immediately and decided to try it out. I'm happy to report that it has worked fascinatingly for me till now, although it's been just a few days.

In fact, maybe you have noticed that i have started writing articles almost everyday now here on [[http://www.golb.in/][Golbin!]] An I have also started doing some other stuff, including some hobby work. I think that this method is excellent while the slack period continues. After that I will move back to GTD :) To learn about more such methods, click [[http://lifehacker.com/5890129/five-best-productivity-methods][here]].

Do you have productivity techniques that work well for you? I will be happy to learn about them, so do share!
