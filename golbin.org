    - [X] invert the model
      - as-is:
        - article contains pointer to parent comments
        - parent comments contains pointer to children comments
        - drawback:
          - article (and all comments along w/ it) are rewritten to DB when a new comment (at any level) is added
          - hence, bad write-time performance
        - benefit:
          - easy to implement and test
          - good read-time performance (since de-normalized)
      - to-be:
        - article does *not* contain pointer to comment(s)
        - comment contains id, article-id and parent-id
        - comment-id is unique across article only (different articles can have comments w/ same IDs; thus articles can *not* share comments)
        - drawback:
          - finding all comments for an article might be non-trivial, since search + sort
          - bad read-time performance (since not de-normalized)
        - benefit:
          - good write-time performance
      - classic space v/s time compromise

   - body:
Lately, this subject has been doing the rounds in my mind quite frequently. The subject of "LOCNW", or "lines of code not written". The reason for my thinking about it so much is because at my office I work on J2EE and I am disgusted with the verbosity of the language. The sheer amount of Java code that one has to write to achieve even simple tasks is mind boggling. I am a proponent of writing the least amount of code to do a task simply because lesser the lines of code, lesser the bugs that will arise out of them, and easier it is to maintain it. To the extent that I think of the following quotes as sacred.

The thing I don't like about Java is that it has too much [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code][boiler-plate code]]. And instead of trying to remove this boiler-plating (according to the principle of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%2527t_repeat_yourself][DRY]], or don't repeat yourself), the Java community builds tools (IDEs, etc) to make this boiler-plate code generation easier to do, or even automate it completely. So now there is even more code to handle (understand, debug and maintain). Add to that the inclusion of XML. This took the boat from the ...muddy canal... into the ...dirty sea...

Agreed that all this verbosity makes it easier for novices to understand the core of the language easily. But this is at the cost of this understanding being very shallow and full of bad practices, because the language itself promotes too much verbosity. As a result of this (as an extreme example), we get variable names like thisIsTheLoopIterationVariableThatGetsIncrementedByOneForEveryExecutionOfTheLoop :(

Also, simple things get complex too soon, because

   - summary: This article is about how I overcame my fear and found my own eureka moment, how i found the initial inspiration and found the joy of writing.
   - body
Getting a [[www.golb.in][website]] built was a difficult but manageable task. But where do I get the content from? I am no writer myself. I have written a few blog [[blog.spradnyesh.org][posts]], but those were long ago and there was definitely no discipline there. Those were some random, and more importantly, sporadic thoughts that I penned down. However what I am trying to do now is a totally different beast. Of course, the idea is to attract people to write on this website, but before that there needs to be atleast some initial content. It is easier to add content and ideas to an existing work, but very difficult to start something oneself. So that is the responsibility I must take onto myself, to initiate and to lay down some basic foundation.

Ok, so now I have got myself a goal and some determination too. But that does not solve the problem of skill. Having a goal and determination does not make me a writer. So I do the only thing that makes sense, procrastinate! After having delayed the task for a few weeks, I decided to do the inevitable:

<quote>
The best way to get started is to get started. --Anonymous
</quote>

The first thing that I needed to do was get over [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia][inertia]]; I needed to get rid of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_rolling_stone_gathers_no_moss][moss]], get the stone rolling. I started to think about what I should write. That's when I remembered a sentence from one of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purushottam_Laxman_Deshpande][P. L. Deshpande]]'s essays 'Majhe Poshtk Jeevan':

<quote>
Shevati kaay ho, apan sagle jana aahot na, te pattyatlya navache dhani. Majkuracha maalak niralach asto.
</quote>

Literally translated, it means "Finally, we all are just the owners of the name on the address. The owner of the content is someone completely different."

I have always been fascinated with quotations. I have a collection of quotations and phrases, not only from great people, but also anonymous, and even short sentences that I have found very interesting; anything that I have read or heard from anywhere. The most interesting thing that i find about quotations or phrases is that they are open to interpretations. The same sentence can mean different things to different people. Actually, it can mean different things to the same person when read at different times, in different moods, in different circumstances. I think that more important than the sentence is its interpretation; what one gets or understands, what one perceives from it.

For me, in the context of writing my first article on [[www.golb.in][Golbin]], the above sentence meant a lot:
1. I am the author, but what i write is consciously or sub-consciously told to me by _the_ author himself
2. This takes away some pressure from my mind about how will the article be received by the audience
3. I realize that this is only my first attempt; with practice and perseverance I am only going to improve

This is my [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_effect][eureka]] moment! I now understand what is actually meant by inspiration and it culminates in the following [[http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison][quote]]:

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein][Albert Einstein]] once said <quote>Use the brain to process (think), not to store (remember).</quote> Frankly, I don't know if [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein][Einstein]] really said that, but I know that [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studs_Terkel][Studs Terkel]] said <quote>I like quoting Einstein. Know why? Because nobody dares contradict you.</quote> ;) Anyways, the point I am trying to make is about forgetting. I think "forget" is a very important part in the preaching "forgive and forget" because forgiveness, although ideal and saintly, is extremely hard to practice, especially equally and towards all. But it is easy to forget. Actually, it is difficult, nay, impossible, to remember. Now that seems like a bold, very bold, claim. But hang on, and I will explain it shortly.

http://img.diytrade.com/cdimg/845903/7734917/0/1230259307.jpg @ http://xingfei169.diytrade.com/sdp/845903/4/pd-4400116/4969664.html
Lets start by understanding what our memory is like, and how does the process of remembering really work. For a long time it was believed that the memory is like a file cabinet, or a computer hard disk (for the geeks among you). When a memory is created, it is like a file is written and stored in a drawer or a folder. Later, when you remember the memory, it is like retrieving the file and reading the contents off of it. There is absolutely no difference between what is written in the file and what is later read from it, no matter how many times. Of course, one might forget which drawer or folder the file was kept in, and he won't be able to remember that memory; but the memory itself is very much still there.

However, studies have found that the above analogy is wrong, very wrong! The brain does not function this way. To understand memory, we have to understand the structure of the brain. The brain is made up of a lot of cells called [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron/][neuron]]s which are connected to each other via protein chains or links. It is these neurons and the links that make up memories. Let us map this understanding of the brain structure to a memory. A memory is really an event in our past that consists of items (for lack of a better word) like:
1. living things like people, animals, plants, etc
2. inanimate objects like buildings, cars, lamp posts, furniture, etc
3. location, weather, etc
4. conversations, emotions, etc
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Neuron_Hand-tuned.svg/400px-Neuron_Hand-tuned.svg.png @ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron/
Each of these items are stored in neurons and creation of a memory is like creating links or bridges between these neuron cells. Thus memory is inherently associative in nature, and the act of creating a memory is actually creating these associations.

Remembering is the process of scanning these neurons and associations between them. It is a highly imperfect process. It is very much possible that during remembering some of the neurons might not fire, that is, we might miss out on some associations. It is also possible, that some other neurons might fire, which means that we may remember (actually, imagine) something that never happened, or wasn't present, in the particular memory that we're remembering. Thus remembering is a highly creative process; we are, astonishingly, (re-)creating the memory!

Now we know that a memory has a physical presence in the brain; in the form of protein bridges between neurons. We also know that the process of creation and retrieval of a memory is not static, like that of a file cabinet or a computer hard drive, but a very dynamic one. Good! But what are it's implications? That is the next question that naturally comes to mind. Lets find out.

Selective deletion [[http://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/02/ff_forgettingpill/all/][{1}]] [[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id%3Dtotaling-recall][{2}]] [[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2206291/The-fear-factor-Researchers-discovery-technique-erase-short-newly-formed-memories.html][{3}]] [[http://discovermagazine.com/2008/jan/how-to-erase-a-single-memory/][{4}]]: There is a drug called [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisomycin][Anisomycin]] that prevents the creation of the linkage protein. This drug can be used to prevent a memory from being created if administered at the moment when the memory is being formed. However, it can also be used to delete a memory when it is being remembered. This is used clinically to treat [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder][post traumatic stress disorder]] or [[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/index.shtml][PTSD]]. A very good movie [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/][Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind]] was made using this concept. It also gives us some clues about why [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia][amnesia]] happens. And of course who would not remember about the movie [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/][Memento]] when we talk about amnesia? The scariest and most mysterious case about amnesia is about [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Wearing][Clive Wearing]] [[http://www.brainathlete.com/cold-sore-virus-led-severe-amnesia/][{1}]] [[http://www.human-memory.net/disorders_retrograde.html][{2}]] [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DWmzU47i2xgw][{3}]] who cannot remember anything for more than a few moments. Every moment for him is as if he has woken up from a long night's sleep, except that this night has been going on for every moment of more than the last 2 decades.

Of course, "selective deletion" of memory screams for ethics [[http://www.livescience.com/15621-memory-altering-drugs-debate.html][{1}]] [[http://www.salon.com/2011/12/31/should_we_erase_painful_memories/][{2}]]. Is it ethical to delete a memory from a person's brain? As always, this coin has 2 sides too:
1. No
   1. A memory is a very private and personal part of who one is. It is like stealing, forever, a part of your body!
   2. Every person is a sum total of his experiences, his memories. Without memories, he is not what he is!
   3. It can be used for criminal activities.
2. Yes
   1. A memory is not static thing that is stored (created) and retrieved (remembered) with the exact same content every time. It is a process of re-creation; it is the most recent recollection of what is true. This means that it changes slightly every time you remember it; it becomes more about you (your perception/interpretation of the event) than about the event itself.
   2. It can be used for treatment and giving a new life to patients.

http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMzY3NjcxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI5OTM0Mw@@._V1._SY317_.jpg @ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/
The fact that memory is not static, but gets re-created anew, modified slightly, each time, has huge implications.
1. Implanting false memories: I know you are thinking about the movie [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/][Inception]]. And thinking that this guy is surely kidding. But believe me, I am not. It is not only possible, but relatively easy to do. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Loftus][Dr. Elizabeth Loftus]] and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Sacks][Dr. Oliver Sacks]] have done a lot of ground breaking research on this subject. The reason it is easy to achieve is because of the fact that it is very much possible for some unrelated neurons to fire, just as it is possible for some related neurons to not fire.
2. This also means that nothing you remember, or worse still, know, is provably true. Watch the excellent [[http://www.ted.com][Ted talk]] [[http://www.ted.com/talks/scott_fraser_the_problem_with_eyewitness_testimony.html]["Scott Fraser: Why eyewitnesses get it wrong"]] on this subject to know how this can have huge, even legal, implications: <quote>All our memories are reconstructed memories. They are the product of what we originally experienced and everything that's happened afterwards. --[[http://www.ted.com/speakers/scott_fraser.html][Scott Fraser]]</quote>.

Finally I would like to end with an awesome short essay by the Romanian essayist [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Codrescu][Andrei Codrescu]] from the book [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101_Damnations_(book)][101 Damnations]]

<quote>The other day a friend of mine was explaining how she had to move these pixels around her computer and had to add 20 megabytes of memory to handle the operation. I had the disquieting thought that all this memory she was adding had to come from somewhere. Maybe it was coming from me because I couldn't remember a thing that day. And then it became blindingly obvious: All the memory that everybody keeps adding comes from people. Nobody can remember a damn thing. Every time someone adds memory to their machine, thousands of people forget everything they knew. Americans are singularly devoid of memory these days. We don't remember where we came from, who raised us, when our wars use to be, what happened last year, last month, or even last week. School children remember practically nothing. I take the greyhound bus every week, and I swear people on there don't know where they got on or where they're supposed to get off. They explanation is simple: computer companies are stealing human memory to stuff their hard drives. Greyhound I believe has some kind of contract with IBM to steal the memory of everybody riding the bus. They're probably connected by a cable or something. Every hundred miles, poof! Another 500 megabytes get sucked out of the passengers' brains. The computer's thirst for memory is bottomless: the more they suck, the more they need. Eventually, we'll be walking around with a glazed look in our eyes, trying to figure out who it is we live with. And then we'll forget our names and addresses and we'll just be milling around trying to remember them. The only thing visible about us will be these cables sticking out of our behinds, feeding the scraps of our memory to computer central, somewhere in Oblivion, USA. I think it's time for all these memory sucking companies to start some kind of system to feel and shelter us when we forget how to eat, walk, and sleep.</quote>

   - summary:
   - body
I'm sure you have wondered, at some time or the other, "who am i?" Probably, you are the kind of person who has meditated over it, or you might be the kind who does not give it a second thought. Probably you were born in a culture, like the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_India][Indian culture]], where you have heard this question from your elders, or from stories in your childhood. Probably you have gone one step further and wondered or heard questions like "[[http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1988/04/01][why am i here?]]" or "what am i here for?"

But have you ever wondered what does it mean to "be me"? XXX Over any period of time, be it short or long, we are continuously changing. Changing physically - children grow up, adults grow old; emotionally - our moods keep changing constantly; and in many other ways - life is change! But there is one thing that never changes, the feeling of "me". No matter where we are, in what place, in what situation, we always know our "selves". How does this happen? In fact, what is this self?

These questions can be looked at from both a philosophical as well as a scientific point of view. Today we are going to look at it from the scientific angle and delve further into questions like "what is consciousness?", "what does it mean to say 'i am me'?", "where does this consciousness come from?", "can we point to a point or location in the brain which generates consciousness?", and the like.

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/NICO_looks_at_himself.jpg/640px-NICO_looks_at_himself.jpg @ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test
Lets start with the question of "Do other creatures, have a sense of self?" It appears that there are a few animals and birds that do have a recognition of self. It has been found that they can identify themselves and know the self from the others. It is very interesting to know how scientists figure out whether animals, or birds, can identify themselves. In fact, it's a simple but very clever trick; it's called the "[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test][mirror test]]" developed by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_G._Gallup][Dr. Gordon Gallup]] while doing some [[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/167/3914/86][studies]]. XXX Consciousness, or self, is a very intellectual thing. In the mirror test, the animal is able to create a representation of itself that floats free of its body. It can't touch it or smell it, but just by seeing it, it knows that "that's me". This is very fascinating!

http://www.montclair.edu/academy/images/juliankeenan82911.jpg @ http://www.montclair.edu/academy/fellows/fellowsmentors20112012.html
[[http://www.montclair.edu/profilepages/view_profile.php?username%3Dkeenanj][Professor Julian Keenan]] has been able to pinpoint the location of where the idea of the self is generated in our brains. He created an [[http://mentalhealth.about.com/library/sci/0201/blbeth0201.htm][experiment]] using some morphing software and images of famous people like Albert Einstein and Bill Clinton to [[http://ttbook.org/book/transcript/transcript-you-your-brain][find]] out that if you <quote> press your thumb to the bridge of your nose. Now draw it slowly over the crown of your head to about where you might have a ponytail. That area under your skull is where 'you' are.</quote>

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Vilayanur_S_Ramachandran_2011_Shankbone.JPG/420px-Vilayanur_S_Ramachandran_2011_Shankbone.JPG @ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilayanur_S._Ramachandran
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilayanur_S._Ramachandran][Professor V. S. Ramachandran]], a world renowned neurologist, says that "self is the activities of the neurons." Although, simple when stated that way, it is, he says, one of the greatest realization in the last 100 years. He explains how the human brain is different from that of other animals. A worm, for example, does not have a brain big enough to form any sort of images in its mind. A monkey, on the other hand, although able to form images, cannot manipulate them in his mind. A human being, however, has a much more powerful brain. Only man can take images from the real world, pull them into his head, divide them into parts and then start turning those parts into abstractions, or tokens. He can manipulate these tokens and juxtapose them in counterintuitive ways; he can create even outlandish scenarios - what we call imagination. We are not different from other animals, we are only more than them. XXX We are imagining so often and so thoroughly, that we can eventually imagine ourselves! He says, self is the ability of humans to spin a story around themselves. We can take experiences, memories of good and bad events, and abstract a story out of it - that is self!

Readers of classic novels are not unaware of "[[http://www.amazon.com/Strange-Jekyll-Dover-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486266885][The strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]" by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson][Robert Louis Stevenson]]. He said that he used to dream of "[[http://blog.beliefnet.com/dreamgates/2011/07/robert-louis-stevenson-and-his-dream-helpers.html][little people]]" who helped him write his stories. He trained himself to remember his dreams and to dream plots for his books. Dreams bring us to a very interesting question about consciousness. If we think about this in modern terms, like when you see a movie, you, the viewer, has no idea what is going to happen next. You scream at the scary parts, laugh at the jokes, and cry during the sad scenes. But in order for you to have that experience, someone needed to write the movie, someone needed to direct it, someone other than you. How is it, when we dream, that we do all 3 at the same time? We write, direct and watch the film as if we've never seen it before.

This is how [[http://www.wnyc.org/people/jad-abumrad/][Jad Abumrad]] and [[http://www.wnyc.org/people/robert-krulwich/][Robert Krulwich]] of [[http://www.radiolab.org/][Radiolab]], in their episode "[[http://www.radiolab.org/2007/may/07/][Who Am I?]]" find it:
<quote>
If you look scientifically into a brain, what you encounter is hundreds of thousands of players, not just little people, but teeny teeny teeny teeny brain cells which do others fashion back and forth. If you would go to any one of the cells and say, "so, are you the author of 'Jackyl and Hyde'?", the cell would just go on or off. It is only in the group that you can see the electrical outline of a thought, or ultimately of a self. While you think of yourself as a 'one', even the thought, 'I am a one', springs from a 100 million cells connecting through a trillion synapses and that all of this multiple activities, paradoxically, creates the you of this moment. You are always plural!
</quote>

There is also a medical side to our consciousness. There is a condition of the brain called [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm][cerebral aneurysm]] in which the person loses his sense of self; he becomes a completely different person. Writer and producer Hannah Palin writes about her experience when her mother suffered from aneurysm in "[[http://www.transom.org/shows/2004/200403_head_explode.html][The day my mother's head exploded]]". I like the following paragraph from the passage a lot:
<quote>
But then those moments pass and you're consumed by the trivia of daily life once again. Sometimes, when i'm overwhelmed by making my way through the world, i try to focus on the fact that the electric bill does not matter. The idiot driver glued to his cellphone, does not matter. The mind numbing day job, truly, does not matter. But welcoming the strange and the different, being open and available for my husband, my friends, my family, experiencing love and laughter as often as possible -- that's what matters. Because it can all be taken away in one brilliant flash.

   - summary: Feedback from my wife takes me onto a journey to discover the different styles of writing.
   - body:
As a birthday gift to my wife, I released this [[http://www.golb.in/][website]] on her birthday and uploaded the articles that I had written already. I asked my wife to read them and give me feedback. Personally, I would have rated them in the order of:
     1. What makes you, you?
     2. Forgetting "forgive and forget"
     3. Discovering the joy of writing
But to my utter surprise, she rated them as:
     1. Discovering the joy of writing
     2. Forgetting "forgive and forget"
     3. What makes you, you?
[[http://www.golb.in/discovering-the-joy-of-writing-1.html][Discovering the joy of writing]] was my first article and I had written it without a very clear mind and without much purpose. For the other 2 articles, on the other hand, I had done quite some research and had taken sufficient time to write and rewrite them. How was it, then, that my wife liked [[http://www.golb.in/discovering-the-joy-of-writing-1.html][Discovering the joy of writing]] the most? I asked her and she told me that she liked writings (articles, novels, etc) that talked to her. [[http://www.golb.in/discovering-the-joy-of-writing-1.html][Discovering the joy of writing]] did just that. [[http://www.golb.in/forgetting-forgive-and-forget-2.html][Forgetting "forgive and forget"]] and [[http://www.golb.in/what-makes-you-you-3.html][What makes you, you?]], however, are, what she calls, gyaan sessions, i.e. "boring".

I thought, that if I am to write, I should understand the different styles of writing. And I am not talking here about grammar, but the different genres, if you will, of writing. I thought about it a lot and the following are the different styles that I could recognize:
     - Imagination: Novels, poems fall into this category.
     - Reporting: This is mostly laying down the facts about an event or incident.
     - Contemplation: In this style, the writer has thought over and pondered about something and is writing his learnings about that topic.
     - Share: Sometimes you find out something interesting or clever, most probably in your domain of work, and you want to share it with your friends and/or the community at large. You also want to note it down somewhere where it is easy to find it later if you need. Many people use personal blogs to accomplish this.

I am sure there will be many more styles. But these are the ones that I could think of. While enumerating them, I also realized that there are multiple axes across which writing styles could be calibrated. I can think about only two right now: the one above, and the "talking" versus "boring" that started this whole train of thought. However, I think that some combinations are more compatible with each other than others. For example, "Imagination" goes well with "talking", whereas "Reporting" goes well with "boring" ;)

Of course, as a budding writer, I have to realize that I cannot be good at all styles, and neither do all people like to read all styles. So it is not possible to please everyone, and that is OK. What I have to do is to try my hands at various styles, figure out what I am most comfortable at, get feedback, and improve!

So to start off, I thought of doing an experiment. I decided to write this article in the "talk" style that my wife had told me earlier. It seems to be on the "contemplation" point on the other axis. Through this experiment, I want to find out whether I have the ability or knack of writing in this style and also see what are the views and opinions of my readers. It is for this reason that you will find no links pointing out to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page][wikipedia]] or other sites from this article. It is all my thoughts, and my thoughts only :)

Fortunately, I think that I have figured out the key to success. It's "curiosity". It is the one thing that cuts across all barriers and all axes. It is curiosity, of any form, and in any domain, that makes us humans. I am sure, you must be curious that where I have used the curiosity factor in this article. Guess? Well, it is the "title" of this article: "writing flavors". Did you not think that flavors are associated with taste, not writing. You must have guessed that this article would either be about some recipe or about writing recipes on blogs or somewhere. But then the summary of the article should tell you that that is not the case. So now you want to know, what the article is really about, and that is what brought you till here!

So what do you think? Does this flavor suit me well?
   - notes:
     - styles
       - share a eureka moment (discovery/invention)
       - imagination (story telling)
       - reporting (event, news, etc)
       - contemplation (thoughts)
     - wife's feedback: talking v/s gyaan (so many people saying so many things)
     - success factor
       - different people like to read different flavors
       - different people have different writing styles; one can't write all
       - but try to be catchy => something that makes curious (curiosity is common to all humans)
         - eg: kinds of writing -> writing kinds -> writing flavors
       - "best selling author" not "best read author"

   - summary: Writing about writing!
   - body:
<blockquote>
"[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_be,_or_not_to_be][To be, or not to be, that is the question:]]"
</blockquote>
That is the opening phrase of a soliloquy in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare][William Shakespeare]]'s play [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet][Hamlet]]. Of course, that is a very serious question, and believe me we are not going to discuss something that important. But what we are going to discuss is an interesting, if not important, question: to blog, or not to blog.

As you must have noticed, I am a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie][rookie]] blogger. So what I am going to enumerate here are my thoughts about why one should start to blog, or not; I am not going to mention benefits or drawbacks of professional blogging (like making money, etc).

If you have ever blogged, or if you think about it deeply for just a short time, you will immediately realize the following benefits:
1. Clear thinking: as a [[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/wannabe][wannabe]] blogger, you have a lot of things in your mind that you want to pen down. The problem, nay challenge, is which of those things should be before others? In fact, which ones are suitable (good topics, not unnecessarily common/general, etc) to be blogged about in the first place. Also, once you have chosen the thing that you want to start writing, you might realize that the topic wasn't big enough to make a decent blog post. Or worse still, you might find that the thing in your mind was a very vague concept and you really don't know how to put it in words. Obviously you will have to think in detail about it and from various viewpoints. As you write more and more posts, you will do this exercise repeatedly and will get a hang of thinking more and more clearly.
Starting to blog is like trying to clean up a wardrobe into which you have been dumping clothes your whole life. It's a mess. But slowly, you will remove the mess, throw away the old, torn, unnecessary clothes, clean the good ones, iron them and arrange them back neatly in the wardrobe. Needless to say, as you clear up your brain, other aspects of your life will start getting affected too.
I think this one reason itself is enough to start blogging!

2. Ideas: Once you have written a few posts, you will start looking for new ideas. Not that you have exhausted all of yours already, but because you are searching for that domain in which you are the most comfortable. You have ideas from all fields of life based on the experiences that you have had during your lifetime. But you want to write about things that are more relevant to your readers, probably related to what is happening in your society at this time, or probably about a certain technology that they are using, etc.
What is important to note here is that a lot of ideas are flowing your way, and then who knows, probably you will yourself convert some idea into something more tangible and move from being a blogger to an [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur][entrepreneur]].
<blockquote>
[[http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/147][There is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come. --Victor Hugo]]
</blockquote>

3. Reading and writing skills: Obviously to gather ideas you will have to become a voracious reader. But at the same time, as your experience grows, you will also become a smart reader -- you will learn to differentiate between good content and bad. You will make for yourself a repository of places that you will visit frequently to hunt for ideas.
Similarly, as you write more and more posts, your writing skills will improve too. You will learn to be able to break ideas into smaller digestible chunks and arrange them in a meaningful order. Also, you might already be good at writing, but might find out, like me, that what you wrote earlier is vastly different than blogging and will need to improve at it.

4. Discipline: As with anything worth doing, blogging takes a lot of discipline. It is very easy to write a few posts in the excitement of starting something new and then getting bogged down with routine tasks and not finding time to blog. This is especially true at the beginning where it is easy to convince yourself that "you were just trying it out", or "you were never serious about it anyways", or "i am not getting any benefit out of it", etc. But this is where you have to persist just long enough for it to become a [[http://www.npr.org/2012/03/05/147192599/habits-how-they-form-and-how-to-break-them][habit]] and you will feel natural about it.

5. Reach a wide audience: The Internet has literally made the world a small place; you can reach a multitude of people from different countries, cultures, races and with different thinking. If you have "comments" feature on your blog, you will be surprised, sometimes, to find comments from varied people. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there is someone on the other side of the earth who is interested in reading what i write; believe me, it was a very motivating moment.

Of course, like other things, blogging is a 2 sided coins and has drawbacks too.
1. Raw: As a newbie, you will make a lot of mistakes. One of them is that you will either open up your heart too much or too little. In the former case you might get backlashed by your visitors (which is good for your blog ;), but not for you), whereas in the latter case your users might not connect to you and will become disinterested soon.

2. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis][Analysis paralysis]]: You might spend too much time reading other content to find ideas and analyzing what to write than actually writing something. This is actually not that bad; atleast you are increasing the horizon of your knowledge. It will surely come in handy at some point in your life.

3. Frustration: This can be especially true with newbie bloggers like me, where we see no user comments for a long time and it might feel like speaking to an empty auditorium. Don't worry, try to figure out if you are doing something wrong and correct it. More importantly, be patient. Probably, the clock gears are already working in the background, but it will take some time for the hand to visibly move :)

For me, the pros outweigh the cons by a huge margin. I have started blogging and am not looking back now. I hope you will too!

   - summary Steps to get virtualbox-guest-additions to work on Sabayon Linux as a guest OS
   - body
First, things keep changing continuously in the Linux world. Secondly, configurations differ, ergo YMMV ;)

With that out of the way, lets attack the main issue. Thing is, i spent a total of 6 hours trying to get virtualbox guest additions to work my Sabayon Linux guest on a WindoZZZe-7 host :((

unfortunately the [[https://wiki.sabayon.org/index.php?title%3DHOWTO:_Install_VirtualBox][Sabayon wiki]] does not help much for when Sabayon is installed as a guest

i got all sorts of errors right from guest addition features like full-screen and shared folder mounting not working to xorg crash without much helpful error logs. Anyways, long story short, i was able to solve all these problems by following the steps below

note: 1. your kernel and virtualbox version numbers might vary
2. simply installing virtualbox, pulls a new kernel, which makes things even more difficult

      1. equo install sys-kernel/sabayon-sources-3.11.2 sys-kernel/linux-sabayon-3.11.2 x11-drivers/xf86-video-virtualbox-4.2.18#3.11.2-sabayon app-emulation/virtualbox-modules-4.2.18#3.11.2-sabayon app-emulation/virtualbox-guest-additions-4.2.18#3.11.2-sabayon
      2. kernel-switcher switch linux-server-3.11.2
      3. add 'modules="vboxdrv vboxnetflt vboxnetadp vboxsf"' in /etc/conf.d/modules
      4. add user to vboxusers and vboxguest groups
      5. add virtualbox-guest-additions to default runlevel
      6. eselect opengl set ati
      7. do *NOT* do the following. basically don't use vboxvideo driver, instead use an empty xorg.conf file and things should just work fine
         1. cp /usr/share/doc/virtualbox-guest-additions-4.2.18/xorg.conf.vbox /etc/X11/xorg.conf
         2. eselect opengl set xorg-x11
         3. append 'vboxvideo' to /etc/conf.d/modules (in step-3 above)

Even after doing all above, i'm still facing some issues. I'd be grateful if someone could kindly tell me the solution, or even tell me a better/correct-er way of getting things to work:
-- shared folders work weirdly: i cannot view/enter contents of shared-folder. however, i have a soft-link to a file inside a shared folder, and i am able to read/write from/to the file without any problem. weird, huh???
-- clipboard sharing does not work

   - summary: Beauty lies in the eyes of the be(er)-holder
   - body:
I have this (weird?) habit of collecting sentences -- quotes, proverbs, and the like. Any time i read something interesting anywhere, be it a book, blog or a magazine, or even a billboard, anything really, i note it down into my small (about 550+ lines long now) file of quotes. I also have a small program i wrote more than 5 years ago that shows me 1 line from the file everyday, and also sets it as my messenger status and email signature.

Anyways, a few days ago, i read the following quote:
[[http://www.iwise.com/tocbM][Catch a man a fish and you can sell it to him. Teach a man to fish, and you ruin a wonderful business opportunity. --Karl Marx]]
and immediately my thoughts went to the proverb:
[[Http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/2279.html][Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime. --Chinese proverb]]
There is hardly a man who does not know the above proverb.

But what struck me about these 2 quotes was that more important than a "thing", is the "point-of-view". How you view something, or what you are thinking when viewing something might completely change the appearance of that thing. This applies to not only inanimate things, but also to people. We tend to have pre-conceived notions about certain people, or group of people and label them. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimamanda_Ngozi_Adichie][Chimamanda Adichie]] tells beautifully the dangers of having pre-conceived notions in this [[http://www.ted.com/][ted]] [[http://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story.html][talk]].

Not only that, quotes change over time, especially when different points-of-view come into play, as can be seen [[http://www.amatecon.com/fish.html][here]]. Anyways, as they say, "Beauty lies in the eyes of the be(er)-holder ;)"

     - what
       - A lucid dream is a dream in which you know you are dreaming. Typically this happens when the dreamer experiences something strange, and when they stop to question their reality, they realize they are in a dream. Lucid dreams happen naturally on occasion, although some people may have them naturally more often than others. --http://www.dreamviews.com/content/what-lucid-dreaming-16/
       - Lucid dreaming is awareness of the fact that you are dreaming. This awareness can range from very faint recognition of the fact to something as momentous as a broadening of awareness beyond what has ever been experienced even in waking life. Lucid dreams usually occur while a person is in the middle of a regular dream and suddenly realizes that they are dreaming. Once you realize this, you have the ability to control your dreams, which is pretty much the most essential part of lucid dreaming. --http://www.wikihow.com/Lucid-Dream
     - why/benefits
       - talk to subconscious: know more about yourself
       - visualize and rehearse a scenario (asking boss about raise, achieving a goal, etc)
       - greater confidence, improve creativity
     - how
       1. keep a dream journal
       2. learn the best time to have a dream
       3. try different techniques like MILD, WBTB, WILD, etc

I was listening to a [[http://www.radiolab.org/][radiolab]] episode a few days ago when I stumbled upon the words "lucid dreaming". It piqued my curiosity and I looked it up only to find very interesting things about it. So what is "lucid dreaming"? To quote [[http://www.dreamviews.com/content/what-lucid-dreaming-16/][dreamviews.com]]

A lucid dream is a dream in which you know you are dreaming. Typically this happens when the dreamer experiences something strange, and when they stop to question their reality, they realize they are in a dream. Lucid dreams happen naturally on occasion, although some people may have them naturally more often than others.

Now, why would anyone want to be aware of what dreams he's having? Well, there are some very interesting advantages:
- A dream (in which you are aware) is like talking with your subconscious. And I mean literally talk. You can ask it questions, and it will answer back. You can learn something about yourself which you never knew. Maybe find out your passions, fears, etc. Sometimes it's difficult to "really" know what you "really" like/dislike. This technique will help you find it.
- Being aware that you are dreaming makes it possible to modify a dream and even control it. This makes A dream an ideal place for visualization and rehearsal. This is very useful due to the following 2 facts
  - Because brain activity during the dream state is the same as during a real life event, what you "learn" or "practice" in your lucid dream state is similar to the training and preparation you do in the waking world.  Your neuronal patterns are already being conditioned. --http://www.dreammoods.com/dreaminformation/dreamtypes/luciddreams.htm
  - Visualization techniques are great tools for "goal achievement" (for example, see [[http://ezinearticles.com/?Visualization---How-to-Achieve-Your-Goals&id%3D8006701][here]], [[http://www.essentiallifeskills.net/visualization.html][here]], [[http://ezinearticles.com/?Visualization-Techniques---Using-the-Mind-to-Achieve-Goals&id%3D3534478][here]], [[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-niles-phd/visualization-goals_b_878424.html][here]] and [[http://voices.yahoo.com/goal-setting-visualization-techniques-263469.html][here]])

Lets come to the "how" of "lucid dreaming". There is a ton of good material out there to help you if you are interested. But here are some starting points

We have been absent from writing articles for some time now because we were working on improving the [[http://www.golb.in/][Golbin!]] experience. For both viewers and story-tellers!

So lets see what's new in [[http://www.golb.in/][Golbin!]]:
1. Load comments via [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)][ajax]]: This feature will load comments in a lazy fashion; that is, after the whole page has been loaded. Because of this, the page-load-time (as seen by search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo!, etc) will improve and give [[http://www.golb.in/][Golbin!]] a better [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization][SEO]] ranking.
2. Threaded comments: Viewers can now reply to existing comments, or add fresh new comments of their own. We hope that this will increase viewer engagement. Not only via interaction within themselves, but even the story-teller will be able to respond to particular comments and have a meaningful, relevant and easy-to-follow conversation!
3. Page backgrounds: Story-tellers can now define a custom image for all of their pages (story pages, and author page) and make their stories more beautiful and attractive for viewers. Also, this will help them distinguish themselves from other story-tellers, and portray their personality more effectively!
4. Improved editorial site timing by 100x: Last, but not least, we made some performance improvements to the editorial site. This small change alone brought the page timings down from 3 seconds to 30 milliseconds, an improvement of 100x!

That's not all. We will be adding new features, both small and big, regularly. Sometimes they will be user facing (affecting either viewers and/or story-tellers) and sometimes not. But either ways, we will keep you folks updated. See you soon, with the next set of updates!

ps: We would be delighted to hear from you about what features you would like to be added to our site! Also, don't feel shy to go ahead, register, and share your stories with the world!

   - body:
I recently came across the following scenario in my work-place. We use [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion][SVN]] as our [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control][version control]] repository, and use a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(software)][trunk]] for production pushes and feature branch for feature development. However, this time we made the mistake of merging feature-branch into trunk-prematurely; because the client team wanted to test both trunk features/bug-fixes and feature-branch changes together before the next launch (a very valid ask).
Now the issue is that if we get an critical bug that needs to be fixed ASAP, then the trunk is no longer clean to do a bug-fix and re-deploy.
However, on the other hand, we could not have merged the trunk changes into the feature-branch, because merging back (into trunk, after feature-branch work is done and tested) would have been a nightmare. Basically we chose the easier merge (feature-branch -> trunk) now, in order to avoid the (super) messy merge (trunk -> feature-branch -> trunk) later on.
I think we faced this issue because how SVN handles merges. Basically, it takes the 2 copies of the same file at the HEAD of each branch and tries to do a intelligent merge; it does NOT take the history of the changes into consideration while merging. This causes conflicts
-- less when we do feature-branch -> trunk, because (hopefully) the same files would not have been touched in both the branches
-- but (too) many when we do trunk -> feature-branch -> trunk, because every (merge) file is touched in both branches
So how do we solve this situation? What do we do?
Enter git! In git, then branch and commit situation is extremely different (and easy). After creating a feature-branch, one should do "git rebase <trunk>" regularly to pull changes from trunk (known as "master" in git-land) into the feature-branch. This way, the conflicts, if any, will be very small and easily resolvable. Once the feature development and testing is complete, on simply does "git merge <feature-branch>".
The benefit of this approach is:
-- the feature-branch always has all trunk changes, so the client-team request can be easily fulfilled right from the feature-branch
-- final merge (feature-branch -> trunk) is super easy, because no 2 files have changed simultaneously (if they had, then these merge-conflicts have already been resolved during the "rebase" step)
I don't know how to achieve the same in SVN; atleast not easily. Please share if you do!
Fortunately, for us, the issue turned out to be a false-positive, and we got spared.

   - summary: Find out how we sped up our editorial site 100x; and how you can do the same to your own!
   - body:
If you remember, we had mentioned in one of our recent posts that we increased the speed of our editorial site by 100 times. That's right, 100 times! So what is the secret? How did we do it? Well, actually there's the short answer and the long answer.

For all you impatient folks out there, the short answer first: We put extremely long processes (like sending email) into the background and returned the page without waiting for its result!

However, in reality things are not so simple. As [[http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/][Donald Knuth]] put it: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil". So we did what was correct: measure. We performed the following steps:
-- measure page speed (as perceived by end users) using tools like [[http://yslow.org/][yslow]], [[https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/][pagespeed]], etc
-- figure out which requests are taking time
-- split the above requests into frontend (network and client-side) and backend (server-side) categories (explanation of these categories is for another post ;). for now, lets concentrate only on backend issues)
-- during our measurements, we found that the article create/update page was the slowest
-- this was mainly due to activities like sending emails and submitting pages to web-archive.com took the most times. but, we realized that the user need not wait for these activities to finish. thus, by simply putting these activities into a separate thread (and not waiting for the thread to finish execution), we were able to bring down the page load time from 3 seconds to about 30 milliseconds; a whopping gain of 100x

The lessons that we learned from the above exercise were
-- don't do premature optimization
-- measure before starting to optimize
-- go for the low hanging fruits (find the thing that will give the maximum ROI)
-- don't optimize parts that will not have any impact (for eg, improving the performance of some rarely called function from 5ms to 4ms by spending 2 hours is pretty much useless)

We would like to hear about your optimization experiences!

   - summary: What is the productivity technique that works for you?
   - body:
Lately i have been having streaks of unproductive days. Days when i don't feel like doing anything. I think it's OK and normal to have a day or 2 like that, but when it becomes day"s", then one starts to worry. Work starts to pile up and frustration starts to build. Things go from normal to bad to worse. The mounting frustration does little to help getting out of this situation.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not lazy. Quite on the contrary, I'm a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done][GTD]] fan. I use [[http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/][emacs]] and the super-excellent [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] to maintain both notes and tasks. In fact, org-mode was one big reason why i gave up my "Doc-vim" status and entered the life of emacs. Anyways, that's a story for a different day ;)

Coming back on track, so here I am, in the midst of such a streak when I stumbled upon "don't break the chain" approach to productivity. Earlier i have read about (and given a try) to methods like "[[http://pomodorotechnique.com/][pomodoro technique]]", etc. But they did not work for me.

Of course, i understand and agree that pomodoro technique is more for time-management and not motivation to get out of a slack phase. It works best when i have too much work to do but I am getting distracted and/or interrupted too often. It allows me to have uninterrupted time-slots for tasks, where i should be able to focus and concentrate without any distractions.

But, we should also realize that it's not possible to be super busy 24x7. There will be times when one does not have too much work. Of course, these days are there to allow one to recuperate, regain that lost energy (from the last sprint), store some extra energy (for the next sprint). Also, these days are excellent times to learn something new and expand our knowledge base, or get involved in some hobby -- maybe something that you've wanted to do for a long time but never got the time to get started.

Good! I am in a slack period and have a lot of time. But there is no motivation. I don't feel like doing anything. I'm sure you have felt this too, at some time or the other. So what to do? Enter "[[http://lifehacker.com/5886128/how-seinfelds-productivity-secret-fixed-my-procrastination-problem][don't break the chain]]". I recently stumbled over it [[http://lifehacker.com/5939526/lift-for-iphone-keeps-you-on-track-helps-you-master-seinfelds-productivity-method][here]]. I must agree that i liked it immediately and decided to try it out. I'm happy to report that it has worked fascinatingly for me till now, although it's been just a few days.

In fact, maybe you have noticed that i have started writing articles almost everyday now here on [[http://www.golb.in/][Golbin!]] An I have also started doing some other stuff, including some hobby work. I think that this method is excellent while the slack period continues. After that I will move back to GTD :) To learn about more such methods, click [[http://lifehacker.com/5890129/five-best-productivity-methods][here]].

Do you have productivity techniques that work well for you? I will be happy to learn about them, so do share!

<p>
	Lately i have been having streaks of unproductive days. Days when i don&#39;t feel like doing anything. I think it&#39;s OK and normal to have a day or 2 like that, but when it becomes day&quot;s&quot;, then one starts to worry. Work starts to pile up and frustration starts to build. Things go from normal to bad to worse. The mounting frustration does little to help getting out of this situation.</p>
<p>
	Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not lazy. Quite on the contrary, I&#39;m a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">GTD</a> fan. I use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/">emacs</a> and the super-excellent <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> to maintain both notes and tasks. In fact, org-mode was one big reason why i gave up my &quot;Doc-vim&quot; status and entered the life of emacs. Anyways, that&#39;s a story for a different day ;)</p>
<p>
	Coming back on track, so here I am, in the midst of such a streak when I stumbled upon &quot;don&#39;t break the chain&quot; approach to productivity. Earlier i have read about (and given a try) to methods like <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">pomodoro technique</a>, etc. But they did not work for me.</p>
<p>
	Of course, i understand and agree that pomodoro technique is more for time-management and not motivation to get out of a slack phase. It works best when i have too much work to do but I am getting distracted and/or interrupted too often. It allows me to have uninterrupted time-slots for tasks, where i should be able to focus and concentrate without any distractions.</p>
<p>
	But, we should also realize that it&#39;s not possible to be super busy 24x7. There will be times when one does not have too much work. Of course, these days are there to allow one to recuperate, regain that lost energy (from the last sprint), store some extra energy (for the next sprint). Also, these days are excellent times to learn something new and expand our knowledge base, or get involved in some hobby -- maybe something that you&#39;ve wanted to do for a long time but never got the time to get started.</p>
<p>
	Good! I am in a slack period and have a lot of time. But there is no motivation. I don&#39;t feel like doing anything. I&#39;m sure you have felt this too, at some time or the other. So what to do? Enter &quot;<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5886128/how-seinfelds-productivity-secret-fixed-my-procrastination-problem">don&#39;t break the chain</a>&quot;. I recently stumbled over it <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5939526/lift-for-iphone-keeps-you-on-track-helps-you-master-seinfelds-productivity-method">here</a>. I must agree that i liked it immediately and decided to try it out. I&#39;m happy to report that it has worked fascinatingly for me till now, although it&#39;s been just a few days.</p>
<p>
	In fact, maybe you have noticed that i have started writing articles almost everyday now here on [[http://www.golb.in/][Golbin!]] An I have also started doing some other stuff, including some hobby work. I think that this method is excellent while the slack period continues. After that I will move back to GTD :) To learn about more such methods, click <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5890129/five-best-productivity-methods">here</a>.</p>
<p>
	Do you have productivity techniques that work well for you? I will be happy to learn about them, so do share!</p>

   - summary: I have learned more git techniques in this week than in the past few months!
   - body:
As always, [[http://www.git-scm.com/][git]] rocks! I have been using git for all my personal projects for at-least the last 2 years now. But what I have learned in this week is probably more than what I have learned in the last few months, and I am dying to share them with you!

git-bundle: Honestly, I learned this maybe in the last month, or the month before that. But then, I wasn't blogging actively at that time. So what the heck? I will share it with you as if I have learned it in this week ;)

Anyways, coming to the real issue that "git-bundle" solves. I work in a jail environment; well not really, but what's the fun in something if there is not even a little hint of exaggeration? The point is that we are not allowed access to git hosting sites like [[https://github.com/][github]], [[https://bitbucket.org/][bitbucket]], etc. So I was having trouble moving my personal projects (that I work on during my free/slack (see my article "don't break the chain" to see how to make productive use of slack time) time between home and office without access to a central repository to sync between my home and office repositories. I searched for other github-like sites (even paid) that I might have access to from my jail, but without success. I was very frustrated.

And then, instead of looking outward, I looked inward (wow, that came out very philosophical!). That is, instead of finding websites that could help me, I searched for whether git has any functionality that could liberate me. And voila, the thing that I found "git-bundle" was exactly what I was searching for.

That's enough of history. Lets get to the details of how git-bundle helped me. For explaining the situation however, we need to set up some environment. Let's say the 2 repositories (home and office, in my case) that we want to keep in sync are A and B. We will cover 2 cases. case-1 is where we have created a new repository (A), and where B has not been setup yet. case-2 is where both A and B exist already (say before access to github was removed), and you have now made changes to one of them, say A. Lets start with the 1st case first:

Perform the following steps at A:
1. cd <repo>
2. git bundle create <repo-name>.bdl master
3. git tag -f "bdl" master

Note that the ".bdl" extension is completely arbitrary, and git does not put any restrictions on it. Similarly you can decide on what tag you want to use. Tagging is useful when sending incremental patches (case12), as we will show below.

Back to case-1. Transfer the <repo-name>.bdl file to B (via email, etc) and perform the following steps at B:
1. git clone -b master <repo-name>.bdl <repo>
2. git tag -f "bdl" master

Once the initial setup is done, we simplify our life to be the same as case-2, that is incremental sync. For this case, lets assume that you have made some changes in B and want to move them to A. Perform the following steps at B:
1. git bundle create <repo-name>-<date>.bdl bdl..master
2. git tag -f "bdl" master

Again, the <repo-name>-<date>.bdl filename is completely arbitrary. I like putting the date part in there because that helps me avoid confusion when I am emailing multiple bundles everyday between my office and home. The part where we say "bdl..master" is the "tagging" part that i had mentioned earlier. Basically, what this tells git-bundle is to bundle only those commits that happened between when we had cloned (or "pull"-ed as explained below) earlier and where the HEAD of the master branch is now.

Then, we move the bundle file from B to A, and perform the following steps at A:
1. git pull <repo-name>-<date>.bdl master:master
2. git tag -f "bdl" master

The steps are exactly the same when you want to sync from B to A. Now, lather, rinse, repeat!

ps:
1. read the beautifully written man page "man git-bundle" for more info
2. Looks like this has become a long post. Well I will write about the other git magic stuff in the next post!

    - summary: 2nd post in the git-week series detailing another cool git feature that proved life-saver!
    - body:
Hello again! Today we will see some more git magic. (Click ***here*** to see my previous post on git.)

This time we are going to learn about the "filter-branch" functionality which proved immensely helpful to me in 2 different scenarios, both unrelated, but both of which happened yesterday at different times of the day.

The 1st was that i use 2 different aliases for different projects. Unfortunately, in one recently started project, I used the default (wrong, in this project) user.name/user.email combination. Fortunately, I had not published it into any online repository (see my previous post as to why ;)). So I still had the opportunity to change this information. I knew that it could be done, but did not know how. So I learned it and will share it with you:

git filter-branch --commit-filter 'GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="<new-name>"; GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="<new-name>"; GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="<new-email>"; GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="<new-email>"; git commit-tree "$@";' HEAD

Of course, your case might not be as simple. That is, unlike me, you might need to change based on some condition, or only change a few particular commits. You can find a good example [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/870367][here]].

The second case where filter-branch turned out to be extremely life-saving was in the same recently started project. I have been scraping some info from the Internet and storing these (separate) files in the local repository. It was big data; largest that I have worked on personally, growing at a rate of about 23Mb everyday. Now it turned out that if I would concatenate the contents of these files into a single file then it would keep my directory structure more manageable and also better for the analysis tool that I would use.

But the problem was that I had already scraped data for 3 days (70Mb of data), and even if I removed the original files, they would still be in the history. This would mean that my repository would simple double the moment I moved to the new file format. The solution was to remove these files (I did not really need them in the history since I was still retaining the "data" in the new format) from history. This is where "filter-branch" feature of git came in handy again. The commands to achieve this are:

git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch $files" HEAD
rm -rf .git/refs/original/ && git reflog expire --all &&  git gc --aggressive --prune

Fortunately, even though I had hundreds of (small) files, I had created the filenames in the <date-in-yyyymmdd-format>-<source> format, so it was very easy for me to invoke the commands like so:

git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch <yyyymm>-*" HEAD
rm -rf .git/refs/original/ && git reflog expire --all &&  git gc --aggressive --prune

The 2nd "rm -rf" command is needed to remove temporary files that git maintains for a long time even after asking it to clear everything.

With this technique, I was able to reduce the repository size (after adding the new format files) to about 60%, a good saving :)

Remember, both the above actions are destructive and may mess up your repository, so it's best to try them out on a clone first. Also, do NOT do them if you have already published your changes to prevent others from facing non-fast-forward pull errors.

    - summary: 3rd post in the git-week series detailing another cool git feature: git bisect!
    - body:
Hi there. Welcome back to the 3rd post in the "git week" series; visit the previous 2 ***here*** and ***here***. Today I will share another extremely helpful git feature with you all: "git bisect".

I am sure you, like me, have faced situations when a feature, which you were sure was working previously, is found to have stopped working correctly. Obviously something changed in the recent past that broke this feature. If we have automated tests, one of which caught this breakage, then it should be pretty easy to fix. But what we are interested in, in this post, is not "how" to fix, but to understand "what" broke this feature, and "when". Maybe, if you are like my manager, you are also looking out for the "who", to put some blame on.

Anyways, coming back to the issue at hand. So basically, we want to find out that particular fix which broke this feature. This is surprisingly easy to do with "git-bisect". I am sure, that by this time, based on my description above, and based on the name "bisect", you would have guessed what this git feature really does. Well, if you have guessed that this feature will do some kind of a "binary search" or a "divide-and-conquer" strategy to find the bad commit, you are absolutely correct.

So how this works is that you find 2 commit hashes, G and B, which stand for "good" and "bad" respectively. Basically, G is where you know that the feature was working correctly (maybe a commit from a few days ago, or from your last QA certified stable build), and B is where the feature is not working (maybe as simple as the HEAD).

The steps are as follows:

1. git bisect start
2. git bisect bad <B>
3. git bisect good <G>

Once you have given atleast 1 good and 1 bad commit hashes, git goes to work. It will successively give you the middle commit between good and bad and ask you to test. Once git has checked out a particular commit, you should (depending on your development environment) build, deploy and test. Then you know whether this particular commit (the one that git gave you just now) is good or bad. That is whether the feature you are interested in works correctly in this commit or not. Accordingly, you need to tell this to git as follows

git bisect good

OR

git bisect bad

respectively.

Continuing this binary search algorithm, you would have eventually reached the particular commit that introduced the bug. Now you can analyze what went wrong and why and come out of the exercise a learned man :)

After you have finished this bisection exercise, run the following command

git bisect reset

to come out of the bisect session back to where you started from.

One interesting situation you can also use git bisect is the other side of the coin. That is when you knew that there was a (hopefully minor) bug that was never getting fixed for a long time (because it was minor in priority, but was (maybe) difficult to fix) and you find out suddenly that it has been fixed (as a side effect of some recent commit). You can repeat the above exercise in this scenario to find out how the bug got fixed. And be an even more learned man ;)

For more details (advanced usage of git-bisect), RTFM and/or visit [[http://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect][here]]. Do share with us about if you have used git bisect before and how did it help you

Well, if you have guessed that this feature will do some kind of a &quot;binary search&quot; or a &quot;divide-and-conquer&quot; strategy to find the bad commit, you are absolutely correct.</p>
<p>
	So how this works is that you find 2 commit hashes, G and B, which stand for &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; respectively. Basically, G is where you know that the feature was working correctly (maybe a commit from a few days ago, or from your last QA certified stable build), and B is where the feature is not working (maybe as simple as the HEAD).</p>
<p>
	The steps are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>
			git bisect start</li>
		<li>
			git bisect bad &lt;B&gt;</li>
		<li>
			git bisect good &lt;G&gt;</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Once you have given atleast 1 good and 1 bad commit hashes, git goes to work. It will successively give you the middle commit between good and bad and ask you to test. Once git has checked out a particular commit, you should (depending on your development environment) build, deploy and test. Then you know whether this particular commit (the one that git gave you just now) is good or bad. That is whether the feature you are interested in works correctly in this commit or not. Accordingly, you need to tell this to git as follows</p>
<blockquote>
	git bisect good</blockquote>
<p>
	OR</p>
<blockquote>
	git bisect bad</blockquote>
<p>
	respectively.</p>
<p>
	Continuing this binary search algorithm, you would have eventually reached the particular commit that introduced the bug. Now you can analyze what went wrong and why and come out of the exercise a learned man :)</p>
<p>
	After you have finished this bisection exercise, run the following command</p>
<blockquote>
	git bisect reset</blockquote>
<p>
	to come out of the bisect session back to where you started from.</p>
<p>
	One interesting situation you can also use git bisect is the other side of the coin. That is when you knew that there was a (hopefully minor) bug that was never getting fixed for a long time (because it was minor in priority, but was (maybe) difficult to fix) and you find out suddenly that it has been fixed (as a side effect of some recent commit). You can repeat the above exercise in this scenario to find out how the bug got fixed. And be an even more learned man ;)</p>
<p>

    - summary: 4th post in the git-week series describing an awesome git feature that can come very handy at times!
    - body:
Hello again. Welcome back to the 4th post in the "git week" series; visit the previous 3 ***here***, ***here*** and ***here***. Today I will share another extremely helpful git feature with you all: "git subtree".

But before i begin with the actual feature, let me give you the background story about how I came to discover it. I find it useful to explain something by first explaining the situation where I needed to use it. I hope that you find it helpful too :)

Anyways, back to the background story. As I have hinted in my previous stories, I am working on a [[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pet_project][pet-project]] wherein i have to collect a lot of data. Currently I am storing these data files locally in the project git repository itself. However, since I collect this data from multiple machines, I get some pull conflicts. Note that I say "pull" conflicts, not "merge" conflicts. This is because, obviously, not the same file is updated from all these local repositories at the same time. But i mostly get "non-fast-forward" errors.

I think that this can be (almost) solved by first doing a pull before doing a commit, followed immediately by a push. Also, once I setup the cron jobs running on these different machines to run at non-overlapping times, I can remove these conflicts altogether.

However, my issue is not that. My issue is that since my code and data resides in the same git repository, and I don't pull/push my code changes from/to the central repository (due to reasons mentioned in the "***git week, part 1***" story), I end up facing these "non-fast-forward" errors anyways. The obvious solution that comes to mind is to manage the source code and data in 2 separate repositories. Since the data repositories are setup in a sync-ed fashion (as mentioned in the previous paragraph), and the source repository will be changed explicitly by me (in a non automated manner (using cron jobs, for example), I can explicitly push/pull the changes to/from the central repository (even if I change the code from multiple locations); that is by following the steps mentioned in "***git week, part 1***" story. This way I will get rid of all these "non-fast-forward" errors that git has been throwing at me previously. Yay!

Ok, now to get to the technical part. How to split the original repository into 2, one for the data and the other for the source. Before I proceed to that, I am going to describe my source folder setup.

~/my-projects/
    - project-A/
        - config/
        - src/
            - model/
            - view/
            - controller
        - data/
            - db/
            - static/
                - css/
                - js/
                - images/

I am sure that you would have guessed the project to be a web-based project following the MVC architecture. I would guess that your project directory structure would be somewhat similar too.

Our objective in this exercise is to split out the project-A/data/db (let's call this <new-repo>) out from the current project repository (let's call this <big-repo>). Note, that the important goal of this exercise is to get the history of <new-repo> changes into the new repository. Simply doing the following

mv <new-repo> <big-repo>/..
git rm -rf <new-repo>

would be easy to do, but would not achieve anything, because we would have lost all the history. Fortunately, it turns out that this operation, of splitting <new-repo> out of <big-repo> is so common, that git has introduced a 1-step procedure to achieve our goal. The steps are as follows:

cd ~/my-projects/project-A
git subtree split -p data/db -b project-A-db
cd ~/my-projects/
mkdir project-A-db
cd project-A-db
git init
git pull ~/my-projects/project-A/ project-A-db
cd ~/my-projects/project-A
git rm -rf data/db

The above steps apply to my directory setup. But, generically, we would do the following steps:

cd <big-repo>
git subtree split -p <name-of-data-folder> -b <new-branch-name>
cd <big-repo>/..
mkdir <new-repo>
cd <new-repo>
git init
git pull <path-to-big-repo> <new-branch-name>
cd <big-repo>
git rm -rf <name-of-data-folder>

The most important step of this whole flow, which I am sure you must have guessed by now, is the "git subtree" command. This is the one that does all the magic!

For more details of how the "git subtree" command works, please see [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359424/detach-subdirectory-into-separate-git-repository/17864475#17864475][this]] and [[http://blog.charlescy.com/blog/2013/08/17/git-subtree-tutorial/][this]]

I hope that you have found this story as fun and informative to read as I have found it to write. Do share your thoughts about both git and my writing :)

    - summary: 5th post in the git-week series: git rebase -i
    - body:
Hello again. Welcome to the 5th post in the "git week" series; visit the previous 4 ***here***, ***here***, ***here*** and ***here***. Today I will share another extremely helpful git feature with you all: "git rebase -i".

If you remember, We have already used git-rebase once in the ***svn-unmerge*** post. In that post I already showed how one could use git-rebase to easily handle things that are either too difficult or, at times, impossible to do in SVN. Today we will see an advanced use of git-rebase, that is "git rebase -i". This command allows us to reorder commits. Yes, you read that right! One can actually reorder commits in git. Ain't that cool?

One can easily imagine certain obvious uses of this feature. For example, lets say I always push to central repository from my master branch, but locally use feature branches. Also, I may be working in parallel on 1 or more features and may also fixing bugs directly in the master branch. And I may be merging (after feature completion) from some feature branch into master. In this case, I would want to reorder the commits in a more meaningful order (one that makes more sense and shows a well thought flow to an outsider) on the master before pushing it to the central repository.

In fact, this use case happened to me last week. I was working on a certain feature, and had merged the incomplete feature to master (I know, bad boy ;) ); but, fortunately, not pushed it. Then I noticed a critical bug in the production system which had to be fixed immediately. So now this bug fix is at HEAD of master, and the unfinished feature is at "HEAD~1" location. Obviously I cannot push this state to production. This is where "git rebase -i" saves the day! I do the following

git rebase -i HEAD~1

Here, git opens up an editor asking you to change the order of the commits (newest is at bottom). So I swap the last and one-but-last commit and save and quit the editor. Then I did

git log

to see that the last 2 commits (incomplete-feature and critical-bug-fix) placed in the correct (as desired) order! Now I pushed the critical-bug-fix to central repository and created a build and deployed to my production server. This time, I took the care to not push the HEAD of master, but HEAD~1 to central repository.

As an added bonus, I am going to tell you a special feature of "git rebase -i". That is once git opens the editor for you to reorder your commits, you will notice the following statements at the end of the editor

# Rebase 3a40bd2..ba8573d onto 3a40bd2
#
# Commands:
#  p, pick = use commit
#  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
#  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
#  x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out

If you read these statements carefully, you will notice that "git rebase -i" is allowing you to not only reorder your commits, but to delete, edit, etc your existing commits. This is awesome knowledge and will surely come in handy in the future. Yay!

*WARNING*: Do remember, that this command makes very low level modifications to your repository and you can easily screw things up. So you should always make changes like these to a cloned repository. Also, as always, do NOT make these changes to the part of history that you have already published.

I am going to keep this git-week series like a 5 day work-week and end this series here. I hope you found this (and previous posts ***here***, ***here***, ***here*** and ***here***) useful.

Do let me know if they did, and how. Also let me know if you like my writing and would like me to write more such articles on other topics as well. Your comments will give me the confidence and motivation to "not break the chain" (see my previous article ***don't break the chain***)

Hi there! Although I sincerely hope that you have been reading my recent git-week posts ***here***, ***here***, ***here***, ***here*** and ***here***, frankly, I myself am happy that the week is over. No, no, don't misunderstand me. I am happy that I learned and was able to share these git gems with you all. But, I am currently undergoing some stress, due to
- things not going well at work (read ***this*** to know why)
- I am starting to feel the pressure of "don't break the chain" (read about my attempt at it ***here***)
- Being a newbie to blogging, I am having some difficulty finding good ideas/matter to write about

Anyways, I will do an honest attempt to not only not break the chain, but also to not give under-cooked material to read. Otherwise you might feel bored and go away; now, we don't want that to happen, do we? But at the same time I will keep the topic for today light enough so that I am able to achieve my objectives
- provide useful/entertaining information to you
- improve my [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition][cognitive]] and writing skills
- not break the chain

So the topic for today is "difference between learnt and learned". Before I go on to the formal differences, let me tell you my version of the story. I used to think that "learnt" was something that had happened very very long time ago, like "I had learnt to ride a bicycle when I was 5 years old", whereas "learned" was something that happened very recently, or just now, like "I just learned what this means". Also, I noticed (when saying sentences containing the words in my mind) that I would lean towards using "learnt" almost always instead of using "learned".

Now I am not really sure if this is correct (along with the other definitions that I will show below) or not. What do you think? Probably you too thought similarly.

But 1 important question that I have not said anything about is "why". As in, "why" did i get interested in the difference between "learnt" and "learned" in the first place. Why does it matter to me at all? The story behind this is that when i was writing the post about ***speed your website 100x times***, my editor showed the word "learnt" in yellow color grabbing my attention. I went into spell-check and the only option it showed was "learned"; "learnt" was not there at all in it's suggestions. This confused me because I knew for sure that "learnt" is a valid word. This piqued my curiosity enough for me to quickly search online for meanings and differences between the 2 words.

Anyways, coming back to the actual differences. Unexpectedly I found 2 _unrelated_ differences [[http://www.tellmewhyfacts.com/2007/02/what-is-difference-between-learnt-and.html][here]] and [[http://www.differencebetween.net/language/difference-between-learned-and-learnt/][here]]. The first one says that they are the same words, but pronounced (and spelled) differently in British and American English. Well, that atleast explains
- why I would lean towards using "learnt" instead of using "learned" almost every time (since I am Indian and learn British English. Actually what Indians use is our very own dialect of English, if I may call it that. But lets be content by saying that since India was ruled by the British for more than 150 years, what we use is British English
- why my editor did not show "learnt" in its suggestions; because I am using the American (en-US) language pack for spelling check/correction

The second definition [[http://www.differencebetween.net/language/difference-between-learned-and-learnt/][here]] mentioned "learned" as an adjective, like "he is a very learned man", whereas "learnt" as a verb, like "he has learnt many languages". Looking back, I remember having learnt something like this when I was in school. But I have never been very good with languages (and history and geography and ... (the list goes on, heh heh!)). But hey, I did manage to use the correct word in my previous sentence. Does that mean that I am a learned man now?

What do you think?

	Hi there! Although I sincerely hope that you have been reading my recent git-week posts ***here***, ***here***, ***here***, ***here*** and ***here***, frankly, I myself am happy that the week is over. No, no, don&#39;t misunderstand me. I am happy that I learned and was able to share these git gems with you all. But, I am currently undergoing some stress, due to</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		things not going well at work (read ***this*** to know why)</li>
	<li>
		I am starting to feel the pressure of &quot;don&#39;t break the chain&quot; (read about my attempt at it ***here***)</li>
	<li>
		Being a newbie to blogging, I am having some difficulty finding good ideas/matter to write about</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Anyways, I will do an honest attempt to not only not break the chain, but also to not give under-cooked material to read. Otherwise you might feel bored and go away; now, we don&#39;t want that to happen, do we? But at the same time I will keep the topic for today light enough so that I am able to achieve my objectives</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		provide useful/entertaining information to you</li>
	<li>
		improve my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition">cognitive</a> and writing skills</li>
	<li>
		not break the chain</li>
</ul>
<p>
	So the topic for today is &quot;difference between learnt and learned&quot;. Before I go on to the formal differences, let me tell you my version of the story. I used to think that &quot;learnt&quot; was something that had happened very very long time ago, like &quot;I had learnt to ride a bicycle when I was 5 years old&quot;, whereas &quot;learned&quot; was something that happened very recently, or just now, like &quot;I just learned what this means&quot;. Also, I noticed (when saying sentences containing the words in my mind) that I would lean towards using &quot;learnt&quot; almost always instead of using &quot;learned&quot;.</p>
<p>
	Now I am not really sure if this is correct (along with the other definitions that I will show below) or not. What do you think? Probably you too thought similarly.</p>
<p>
	But 1 important question that I have not said anything about is &quot;why&quot;. As in, &quot;why&quot; did i get interested in the difference between &quot;learnt&quot; and &quot;learned&quot; in the first place. Why does it matter to me at all? The story behind this is that when i was writing the post about ***speed your website 100x times***, my editor showed the word &quot;learnt&quot; in yellow color grabbing my attention. I went into spell-check and the only option it showed was &quot;learned&quot;; &quot;learnt&quot; was not there at all in it&#39;s suggestions. This confused me because I knew for sure that &quot;learnt&quot; is a valid word. This piqued my curiosity enough for me to quickly search online for meanings and differences between the 2 words.</p>
<p>
	Anyways, coming back to the actual differences. Unexpectedly I found 2 _unrelated_ differences <a href="http://www.tellmewhyfacts.com/2007/02/what-is-difference-between-learnt-and.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.differencebetween.net/language/difference-between-learned-and-learnt/">here</a>. The first one says that they are the same words, but pronounced (and spelled) differently in British and American English. Well, that atleast explains</p>

As you all probably already know (from ***here*** and ***here***), I am currently working on a project that needs me to collect data from various online resources. Since this data needs to be collected at regular intervals (due to updates happening to the data continuously), and not in just one go, I am using cronjob scripts to collect this data.

While writing this script I faced a lot of problems, and that is what I will discuss today. In the hope that someone out there will find something important from my mistakes and learnings, and that this post may be helpful in solving similar problems for him/her too.

As always, let me first start with some background. When developing the script, my desktop was behind a proxy. Although both curl and wget have inbuilt proxy support, both of them refused to work for me. With wget, i was getting the following error:

Connecting to 168.219.61.252:8080... connected.
Proxy request sent, awaiting response... 403 Forbidden
2013-12-18 13:39:36 ERROR 403: Forbidden.

My first instinct was that the proxy is blocking the request. But I was able to download the file perfectly from browser (which also goes via the same proxy). I hit a dead end and did not know what to do next. So I searched for command line based download managers instead and found [[http://aria2.sourceforge.net/][aria2]] that worked fine for me. YMMV.

Before going on, let me also mention that I had the following environment variables set

13:47:17 ~ $ env | grep proxy
http_proxy=http://168.219.61.252:8080/
ftp_proxy=http://168.219.61.252:8080/
all_proxy=socks://http://168.219.61.250:8080/
https_proxy=http://168.219.61.252:8080/
proxy=168.219.61.252:8080
no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.0/8,::1

Back to the script now. The reason I needed a script (instead of just a simple wget/aria2 command inside crontab was simply because i needed to do some pre and post-processing to the downloaded content). Anyways, that's besides the point. So lets continue.

I was ready with the script and tested it extensively, both for the download part and post-processing, and ensured that things were working fine. Then i setup crontab as follows:

13:47:19 ~ $ crontab -l
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE - edit the master and reinstall.
# (/tmp/crontab.XXXX4oqDI8 installed on Wed Dec 11 19:42:26 2013)
# (Cron version V5.0 -- $Id: crontab.c,v 1.12 2004/01/23 18:56:42 vixie Exp $)
HOME=/home/spradnyesh

0 */5 * * 1,2,3,4,5 $HOME/project/scripts/download-daily.sh 2>&1 > $HOME/dd.log

I am sure you all know what the parameters of the cronjob line mean. But I will explain them just for the sake of completeness:

1. 0: run at 00 minutes
2. */5: run every 5 hours
3. *: run on every day of the month
4. *: run in every month
5. 1,2,3,4,5: run only on weekdays (mon,tue,wed,thurs,fri)

Having explained that, lets move to the script itself. It looked something like this

#!/bin/bash

##### initial setup
cd $HOME/project/data/
toDate=`date +%F--%H`
prefix='http://www.example.com/'
suffix='&a=b'
outfile='download-daily.txt'

##### download data
rm $outfile
touch $outfile
for i in `cat ../list`
do
    echo "${prefix}${i}${suffix}" >> $outfile
    echo " out=${toDate}-${i}.html" >> $outfile
done
aria2c -j 10 --allow-overwrite=true --remove-control-file=true --remove-control-file=false -i $outfile

##### do some post-processing

git add $toDate.html; git commit -am "added data for $toDate"

The actual details of the script don't matter. Basically, I am simply doing some initial setup, downloading the data, doing post processing including saving the new file to git (read about my previous git experiences ***here***, ***here***, ***here***, ***here*** and ***here***).

Unfortunately ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%2527s_law][Murphy's law]]), the script failed to download any data. On examining closely, I found that the $http_proxy environment variable was not visible inside the script. Researching online on this issue I learnt (to learn about the difference between "learnt" and "learned", visit my previous story ***here***) that the environment available to a script run via cron is very limited (mostly for security reasons), which is why the $http_proxy variable was invisible inside the script.

To deal with this issue, i found a few solutions [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/2229861][here]], [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/10657111][here]], [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/13579786][here]] (this one (and similarly [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/18647100][this]] one and [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/18647100][this]] one) is a big NO NO for security reasons, and also due to limitations as explained [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5934554/crontab-source-file#][here]] and [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/5935335][here]]), but none of them seemed to work for me. What eventually worked for me was setting up my cronjob rule as follows:

0 */5 * * 1,2,3,4,5 env http_proxy=http://168.219.61.252:8080/ $HOME/project/scripts/download-daily.sh 2>&1 > $HOME/dd.log

Do share your experiences with setting environment variables inside of cronjob scripts. Maybe you found some other (easier) way that worked for you. I would really love to hear about it!

     - summary: Day 1 of my week long vacation with family to Busan was spent at the calm but chilly Haeundae beach!
     - body:
First of all, let me wish you all a very happy and prosperous 2014! Second, let me pray for Golbin! to get bigger, both in terms of readers and storytellers :)

This and the next few of my stories are going to be about my week-long travel to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busan][Busan]], South Korea. I went there with my wife and 1 year old daughter in the week of Christmas (23-28 Dec), because of different reasons
1. 23rd was my wife's birthday
2. I had holidays in my office on 24 and 25, so only 3 days of leaves need be taken
3. Busan, I was told, is much warmer (without any snow), but a lot windy, during this time of the year, than [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suwon][Suwon]] (where I reside)

Anyways, so we decided to go to Busan for a week long vacation. We had to prepare for a long time, because this was the 1st time that we were going out for such a long time taking our baby (who is just 1 year old) with us. The preparation revolved mostly around baby clothes, for the windy weather, and home-made baby food. The only thing we had actually reserved before going to Busan were the hotel (we stayed at the [[http://www.rivierahotel.co.kr/EN/][Riviera]] hotel, which was very close to Haeundae beach) and the to and fro train tickets. We did not want to book/reserve other things mostly because there was a huge amount of uncertainty regarding how my daughter would react to a new place. Fortunately, not only did she not give us much trouble, but she also enjoyed the place a lot

<iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/spradnyesh/11624256564/player/f8243639c2" height="375" width="500"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>

Considering that we had our baby with us, we had set low expectations of travel in a day. If we could visit 1-2 places in 1 day, that would be good enough for us. That is also 1 reason for the week long tour, even though some of my (bachelor / newly-married) friends had said that just 1-2 days were enough to visit Busan.

We traveled from Suwon to Busan in the [[http://www.korail.com/en/][KTX]] train, which runs at a max speed of about 280 kmph. The idea of traveling so fast itself was enough reason for me to visit Busan. The other major attraction being the Busan aquarium, about which I had read and heard a [[http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297884-d669986-Reviews-Busan_Aquarium-Busan.html][few good things]], and had especially liked their [[http://www.busanaquarium.com/en/][website]]. I was also looking forward to the journey itself because I wanted to replicate the photography techniques that this guy ([[http://www.qiranger.com/2011/06/10/suwon-to-busan/][here]]) had used; my try was disastrous :(

We started from Suwon station on 23rd morning 10.50am, and reached Busan at around 1.40pm and to our hotel (bus #1003) in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haeundae_District][Haeundae]] at about 2.30pm. Then we rested a bit, had some lunch, and visited Haeundae beach in the evening. Although my wife loved the beautiful beach, we had to return soon to the warm and cozy hotel room because it was a bit too windy and chilly for my daughter to handle

Finally, we ate dinner at [[http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297884-d4166622-Reviews-Namaste-Busan.html][Namaste India]]; the food was very tasty. Since it was my wife's birthday, we had some ice-cream and called it a day!

Before coming to Busan I had done some basic research about the places to visit in Busan. We had found that there are some city tours available. These tours were of 2 different types: looped and themed. The ticket for either was 10,000 won (approx. 10$). The difference between the 2 is that in the looped tour, there are buses that go around Busan in a circular fashion, and you can buy the ticket once (from the driver), and get in and down at any of the places (tourist spots) that the bus stops at. There is 1 bus every 30 mins (between 9.30am and 5pm starting from Busan station), so you can practically go to place A -> visit it for as long as you wish -> hop into the next bus and go to place B -> and so on. This mode of travel is extremely convenient and cheap; especially if you like traveling on your own and don't need a guide (have done some basic homework of what places interest you and you want to visit). There are 2 different routes of the looped tours, called the "[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haeundae_District][Haeundae]]" and "[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taejongdae][Taejongdae]]" loops, and the same ticket works on both.

The 2nd type of city tour buses are the "themed" tours: "History and Culture", "[[http://yongkungsa.or.kr/en/][Haedong YeongGung temple]]", "[[http://busan.for91days.com/2012/07/06/the-eulsukdo-island-bird-sanctuary/][Eulsukdo Eco]]" and "Night view". These tours are about 3hrs 40 mins each, and the buses leave twice a day; except for the "Night view" which is about 2.5hrs long, and runs only once in the evening. One good thing about themed Busan city tours is that you can call up their online help-desk (+82-51-464-9898) and do a reservation but actually purchase the ticket from the driver (at the start of the tour). The bad thing is that the help-desk (in my experience) is open only for about 2 hours between 9-11am in the morning; and some of the tours get full about 10 days in advance.

Anyways, we called up the help-desk in the morning, and were able to reserve 2 seats for the "Haedong YeongGung temple" tour. Since we reached a bit before the tour start time, I clicked a few photos in the Busan station area

YeongGung-sa (sa means temple) was undoubtedly the best place that I visited in Busan. The temple is located on a cliff and the view is extremely serene and beautiful. It is the place that receives the 1st sun light in Korea.

     - summary: Today we took the looped city tour bus and visited Taejongdae
     - body:
The first half of our third day (see the first 2 ***here*** and ***here***) in Busan was the lowest point of the whole week. We had a reservation for the "[[http://busan.for91days.com/2012/07/06/the-eulsukdo-island-bird-sanctuary/][Eulsukdo eco]]" tour in the morning, but my daughter vomited just when we were about to reach Busan station. We had no choice but to head back to the hotel.

Once we were ready again, We took the looped city tour bus and visited [[http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid%3D264167][Taejongdae]]. It is a hill which hosts the Taejongdae resort. This time, we took the Haeundae loop tour bus to go from Haeundae beach to busan and it passed via the famous [[http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid%3D1064834][Gwangan bridge]]:

<iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/spradnyesh/11621884866/player/3b9d96dfda" height="375" width="500"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>

Unfortunately, we made the bad decision of getting down at the "Busan art museum" stop. The decision was bad because after getting down, we went in the wrong direction and spent about 15 minutes just searching for the place. We were already pissed off because of the bad start, so we came back to the bus stop and waited another 20 mins for the bus. But this time we were laughing at our stupidity, because the art museum was just 1 min away from the stop. Anyways, we weren't in a mood to go there after this.

Fortunately, the same bus got converted into the Taejongdae loop tour bus. So we did not have to get down of the bus, but also were able to catch a good window seat ;) On the way to Taejongdae from Busan, we passed the 75-square stop (which we did not get down at). The sea-meets-the-sky view was simply amazing. Here are some ok-ok shots from inside the moving bus

On reaching Taejongdae we boarded the mini tram and saw the place; we did not get down from the tram at any of the stops that it made, including the light-house:

From Taejongdae we took the loop tour bus back to Busan; but this time we got a bus with an open top. This was the first time for both my wife and me to sit in an open roof double-decker bus, and it was an amazing experience. On the way we passed [[http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid%3D1054924][Songdo]] [[http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297884-d3420565-Reviews-Songdo_Beach-Busan.html][beach]] and the world famous [[http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297884-d1372972-Reviews-Jagalchi_Market-Busan.html][Jagalchi]] [[http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid%3D264168][fish]] [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagalchi_Market][market]], but did not get down at either

     - summary: Today was the day for local sightseeing, close to Haeundae beach. And in the process we learnt something extremely (and disappointingly) surprising about the shopping mall that is listed as the largest shopping mall in the world in the Guinness book of world records!
     - body:
Today I wasn't in a mood to travel all the way to Busan station (it's about 35-50 mins from Haeundae beach, depending on the traffic; also the Haeundae -> Busan (bus #1003) route is longer than the other way around). So we decided to do some local sightseeing, which included Busan aquarium and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsegae][Shinsegae]] mall.

As I have mentioned ***here, day-1***, I was super excited to visit the Busan aquarium because it offered the once in a lifetime opportunity to swim with the sharks. Unfortunately, my hopes were shattered because when I inquired about it, I was sent from one desk to another and then asked to call some phone number where the man only spoke Korean. I spent 30 mins running from desk-to-desk, by which time my wife was pissed off because my daughter being difficult to be managed by her alone. We also did not get to sit in the glass-bottomed boat because my daughter was too young. The actual fishes weren't that exciting since the variety was almost the same as what we had already seen in [[http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid%3D736274][COEX mall aquarium]] in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul][Seoul]]. I did manage to get 1 macro image that I liked a lot

Finally, we got a cartoon-painting made of the 3 of us and went back to the hotel for lunch

<iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/spradnyesh/11621846323/player/b24a375893" height="500" width="375"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>

In the evening we visited Shinsegae which has its name in the Guinness book of world records as the worlds largest shopping mall. This time we traveled by the subway because
1. Haeundae subway station was pretty close from our hotel
2. Shinsegae is directly reachable from the "City Centum" subway station
3. City centum station is just 3 stations away from Haeundae station
4. We would be able to avoid the heavy evening traffic

Although we had seen the mall from outside a lot of times now (because it is on the way when traveling Busan <-> Haeundae), this was the first time we were inside it. And although it was not immediately apparent how huge it was, it was fascinating to see an ice-rink inside it. I even gave ice-skating a try but gave up within just 20 minutes after falling hard twice ;)

But the most weird and disappointingly surprising thing about the world's largest mall was that it closes at 8pm! Yes you heard it right, it shuts down at 8pm. This was completely unexpected for us, and very inconvenient too. Because we had to rush out and found ourselves trapped in the wrong part of the mall. The elevators would either take us to a road-side exit (we didn't know which side of the mall), or to a do-not-enter red-tape. Eventually, with a baby in my hands, I did what I had to do. Entered the no-entry zone, found my way to the part that I knew we had entered from (the part that was connected to the subway station) and took the elevator from there. All this crazy running took us about 15 minutes, just to come from the 7th floor to the basement. It was one of the weirdest experience ever!

     - summary: Last day of the week long vacation to Busan!
     - body:
Since today was the last day of tour, we decided to go for the "[[http://busan.for91days.com/2012/07/06/the-eulsukdo-island-bird-sanctuary/][Eulsukdo eco-center]]" themed tour that we had missed on the unfortunate 3rd day. So we got up early and went to Busan station. But it looks like the Eulsukdo tour was jinxed. When I called the Busan city tour help-desk (+82-51-464-9898), they told me that both the morning and afternoon tours were fully reserved. Anyways, we were already in the bus and went to Busan station hoping that someone might skip (like we had on our 3rd day). We reached the station just a few minutes before the departure only to find out that there was just 1 empty seat. Dejected, we tried to decide what to do next. We had 3 options:
1. Visit Beomeosa ([[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beomeosa][1]]], [[[http://koreantemples.com/?p%3D241][2]]], [[[http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297884-d615908-Reviews-Beomeosa_Temple-Busan.html][3]]]) temple ourselves
2. Visit [[http://www.busanhaps.com/article/history-hills-busans-gamcheon-culture-village][Gamcheon]] [[http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297884-d3901349-Reviews-Gamcheon_Culture_Village-Busan.html][culture]] village ourselves
3. Go back to hotel and come back for afternoon tour

We decided to do the third because we did not want to wander out on our own with a baby in our hands. We visited the Haeundae beach on our way back to the hotel, where we saw a lot of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-legged_Kittiwake][black-legged seagulls]] up close

<iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/spradnyesh/11624357126/player/b40239cac8" height="375" width="500"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>

In the afternoon, we left early only to reach 40 mins before time for the Eulsukdo tour. This time our wait was fruitful because we were the 1st people to board the bus and got a good seat too. Unfortunately, there weren't any birds (other than ducks, which was not exciting at all) at the eco-center :(

<iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/spradnyesh/11623740303/player/363e907ca3" height="375" width="500"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>

This marked the end of our tour, and the next day we traveled back from Busan to Suwon on the KTX. Although the train reached top speeds of 290+ kmph, it always did so when inside tunnels, so we weren't able to see outside. But we did notice our ears getting jammed, and could feel the speeds. Also, this time again, I tried to do the photography technique that I had mentioned in the day-1 post ***here, day-1***. This time I had more success, but none of the photos turned out to be good enough. Even then, it was a good learning experience.

I hope you all loved the travelogue (older posts are ***here***, ***here***, ***here*** and ***here***)! Do share your thoughts :)

    - summary:
    - body:
Hello. Welcome back! I am sure that you are as excited to find out about the new features that we have added to our website this week as we are to tell you about it. As mentioned [[http://www.golb.in/exciting-new-features-on-golbin-9.html][here]] previously, we will try our best to continuously add small and big (both user-facing and not) features to our [[http://www.golb.in/][Golbin!]] website. So let's review what's new:

- RSS: We have added a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS][RSS]] stream for all our index pages; that is for the [[http://www.golb.in/][home]] page, and also for all category/sub-category (click [[http://www.golb.in/category/lifestyle/][here]] and [[http://www.golb.in/category/technology/internet/][here]] for example) and author pages (like [[http://www.golb.in/author/spradnyesh/][this]] for example). So now viewers can access [[http://www.golb.in/][Golbin!]] stories from your favorite feed reader. To use this functionality, simple search for and click the "RSS" link present at the bottom of any of our index pages.

- lazyload [[http://www.google.com/][Google]] ads: If you have noticed earlier, google-ads on [[http://www.golb.in/][Golbin!]] pages have always been loading in a lazy fashion (that is, after the whole page has been loaded). But earlier, we were using the awesome jQuery [[http://jqueryad.web2ajax.fr/][lazyload Ad]] plugin. While, it was doing an excellent job, it was adding about 8.5K of javascript (and 1 extra http get request) to the website. But, after google introduced the async form of [[https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3221666?hl%3Den][rendering ads]], we implemented the same. This gives us lighter and faster loading web-pages. We believe that this will improve viewer experience on [[http://www.golb.in/][Golbin!]]

- story page backgrounds: In our last post [[http://www.golb.in/exciting-new-features-on-golbin-9.html][here]], we mentioned that story-tellers now have the ability to provide a custom image as background to all their pages. However, the functionality was limited; because they could only upload 1 image which would apply to all of their pages (story-teller index, and story pages). But now story tellers can have a different background image for each individual stories. If they do not provide an image for a new story but have defined a default image, then the new story will pick up the default image.

As always, we would be delighted to hear from you about what features you would like to be added to our site! Also, don't feel shy to go ahead, register, and share your stories with the world! Click here to see the benefits of writing on [[http://www.golb.in/][Golbin!]]

So now viewers can access <a href="http://www.golb.in/" target="_blank">Golbin!</a> stories from your favorite feed reader. To use this functionality, simple search for and click the &quot;RSS&quot; link present at the bottom of any of our index pages.</p>
<p>
	<strong>lazyload <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a> ads</strong>: If you have noticed earlier, google-ads on <a href="http://www.golb.in/" target="_blank">Golbin!</a> pages have always been loading in a lazy fashion (that is, after the whole page has been loaded). But earlier, we were using the awesome <a href="http://jqueryad.web2ajax.fr/" target="_blank">jQuery lazyload Ad</a> plugin. While, it was doing an excellent job, it was adding about 8.5K of javascript (and 1 extra http get request) to the website. But, after google introduced the async form of <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3221666?hl%3Den">rendering ads</a>, we implemented the same. This gives us lighter and faster loading web-pages. We believe that this will improve viewer experience on <a href="http://www.golb.in/" target="_blank">Golbin!</a></p>
<p>
	<strong>story page backgrounds</strong>: In our last <a href="http://www.golb.in/exciting-new-features-on-golbin-9.html" target="_blank">post</a>, we mentioned that story-tellers now have the ability to provide a custom image as background to all their pages. However, the functionality was limited; because they could only upload 1 image which would apply to all of their pages (story-teller index, and story pages). But now story tellers can have a different background image for each individual stories. If they do not provide an image for a new story but have defined a default image, then the new story will pick up the default image.</p>
<p>
	As always, we would be delighted to hear from you about what features you would like to be added to our site! Also, don&#39;t feel shy to go ahead, register, and share your stories with the world!

   - summary: Taking a different perspective a the "producer consumer" problem outside of the computer world
   - body:
Anyone who has learnt basic "operating system" concepts in their Computer Science engineering knows about the "[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer-consumer_problem][producer consumer problem]]". It is a classic synchronization problem, where there are 2 processes, the "producer" and the "consumer", both sharing a fixed size common buffer. The producer produces something that is consumed by the consumer. The problem is to make sure that the producer does not try to add to an already full buffer and that the consumer does not try to remove from an empty buffer. But today I am not going to discuss this problem from a Computer Science perspective, but from a completely different angle.

I had mentioned in one of my previous articles, ***here (don't break the chain)***, I am trying to write 1 new story every day, or atleast every weekday. Now you might ask what has that to do with the producer-consumer problem. Well, let me explain.

Before I started writing stories everyday, I was a pure consumer. I would only consume posts/stories/articles, really data, from different sources (blogs, forums, email, social-networking sites, etc). But now I am slowly making a shift towards being a producer as well. Obviously, one cannot become a pure producer -- one who only produces (articles/data) without consuming (articles/data), because for the human brain to perform it's magic, it needs a lot of input. A creative mind is one that takes to (apparently) unrelated things, and combines them in such a way as to create something new and coherent out of it.

Having laid out the background of "producer" and "consumer" in my story, let me now get to the "problem" part. Well, I notice that as I am making the move from being a consumer to trying to become a producer, I am falling short of things to write about. There are days, like when I was writing the "git week" series (see ***here (git week, part 1)***, ***here (git week, part 2)***, ***here (git week, part 3)***, ***here (git week, part 4)*** and ***here (git week, part 5)***) when writing was easy. But once the series concluded, I am finding it difficult to find new topics to write on.

I have noticed that I feel comfortable writing about technical things (eg, git-week series, ***svn-unmerge***, ***environment variables in crontab***, etc), than non-technical (***different b/n learnt and learned***, ***don't break the chain***, etc). But sometimes, when I have written part of a post, I feel like either I am not able to reach to a good ending, or like the post is not feeling coherent enough. At such times, I tend to give up much more easily on the post, rather than struggling to complete it. My mind seems to be eager to jump off to a different topic, leaving an unfinished mess behind. And this is the "problem"!

Although I have done some homework on this subject and read techniques to maintain steady writing, it is easier said than done. I think the only way to solve this problem is to have a plan and keep it simple:

- Don't break the chain
- Practice makes perfect

I believe that the 1st rule "don't break the chain" will take me a long way till the gates of the 1st part of the 2nd rule "practice", which will eventually take me to the 2nd part "perfection". What say you?

    - summary: How to make use of the new asynchronous support for google adsense ads instead of the jQuery lazyload Ad plugin
    - body:
I had mentioned in one of my previous articles ***here, More exciting new features for golbin*** that we had changed our lazyloading technique for google-ads on [[http://www.golb.in/][Golbin!]] pages. Today I will show you how we did it.

Previously, we were using the awesome jQuery lazyload Ad plugin as shown in their documentation [[http://jqueryad.web2ajax.fr/][here]]. However, the plugin itself added about 8.4Kb to the page-weight. Even though Golbin! was using measures to lazyload the plugin itself, it was still additional page-weight, especially for first time (with browser cache empty) users.

Then, recently, we noticed that google had made some changes to their [[https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3221666][adsense]] code because of which the ads would be rendered asynchronously, thus removing the need for the jQuery lazyload Ad plugin. Sample code looks like below:

<script async src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
    <ins class="adsbygoogle"
        style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"
        data-ad-client="ca-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
        data-ad-slot="6440411535"></ins>
    <script>
    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
    </script>

So far so good. However, we wanted to go a step further than this because:
1. In our experience, if we put the script in the bottom of the page (just before the ending "</body>" tag), then the ads did not get rendered at all. Putting the js script at page bottom is good performance practice (see [[http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html][here]] and [[https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/rules][here]] for best practices for website frontend performance).
2. Golbin! was already using a technique to lazyload the javascript files needed by the page itself. And we wanted to continue using this technique for the new script too.

Fortunately, one needs to include the script tag only once in the page irrespective of how many ad units were present on the page; this went well with our technique, because then we could lazyload the adsense script and use some JS to invoke some function to show the ads in the correct place.

Our initial HTML markup snippet looks something similar to:

<div class="g-ad">
    <ins class="adsbygoogle"
        style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"
        data-ad-client="ca-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
        data-ad-slot="6440411535"></ins>
</div>

and the supporting javascript code looks like:

$.getScript("//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js",
    function (data, textStatus, jqxhr) {
        var script = document.createElement("script");
        script.type = "text/javascript";
        script.text = "(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})";
        for (var a = null, arr = $("div.g-ad"), i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
            a = arr[i];
            $(a).append(script);
       };
    }
);

If you have ever used jQuery, you will notice that what the above javascript snippet does is that it lazyloads the adsense javascript via the getScript function. And when the adsense javascript is loaded, the anonymous function is called which does the following steps
1. creates a script tag having the code shown in the adsense documentation
2. finds all "div" elements having the class "g-ad"
3. loops through the divs found in the above step and adds the script tag to the div

And voila, we're done! We have now successfully reduced 8.4Kb of page-weight, which means faster pages for our readers :)

The only drawback of this method is that it is impossible to debug it in the javascript debugger (in both firefox and chrome browsers), because the newly added script does not show up in the DOM :(

But don't worry. If this technique has worked for us, it should for you too. So, go ahead and give it a try! And don't forget to share your experiences back :)

    - summary: How to become 20x productive by killing the rat!
    - body:
I have been using [[http://www.linux.org/][Linux]] for atleast the last 9 years, trying out different distributions like [[http://www.redhat.com/][RedHat]], [[http://fedoraproject.org/][Fedora]], [[http://www.debian.org/][Debian]], [[http://www.ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu]], [[http://www.gentoo.org/][Gentoo]] and finally settling down on [[http://www.sabayon.org/][Sabayon]] (for the last 2 years). Similarly, on the desktop manager side, I have used [[http://kde.org/][KDE]] for a long long time, but have been using [[http://www.nongnu.org/stumpwm/][Stumpwm]] for the last 3+ years. On the browser front, I use the awesome [[http://www.vimperator.org/vimperator][vimperator]] plugin for [[http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/][firefox]].

You might think, and correctly at that, "what is this guy talking about? what has all this to do with a rat, or even with productivity (if you read the description of this article on one of the Golbin! index pages)". Well, let me start with the following definition:

mouse, n: A device for pointing at the xterm in which you want to type. --A.S.R. (***???***)

If you don't get the above, I am basically talking about the PC "mouse". I feel that the mouse is only there to slow you down. Based on my personal experience, I can say very confidently that the less mouse I use, the faster I work. Agreed, that it takes a bit of practice, and maybe making some (initially difficult) choices too, but in the long term you will be a completely different person. Notice, that I don't say "a more productive person", but a "completely different person". That is because, using the keyboard changes you in more than 1 ways.

Of course your typing speed will increase, which will make regular things (coding, typing emails, blogging, etc) faster. This alone will help you think faster, because our system throughput is limited by the I/O (typing). Even though we are capable of thinking faster, we end up thinking slowly because our typing puts pauses to our thinking, breaking the flow.

Also, more importantly, your choice of tools/systems will change too. For example, I use the following tools/systems:

Linux: I am a software developer, and strongly believe that every software developer should use a Linux desktop to:
1. learn something more than clicking "next, next, next, finish"
2. getting hands dirty on the terminal. that itself will teach you so many tools (if you don't know how to use "find" and "grep") and techniques (regular expressions, bash scripting, etc) to make you a better developer
3. huge number choice of desktop managers (among other things)

Stumpwm: I always liked KDE better than [[http://www.gnome.org/][Gnome]], simply because KDE allowed a *lot* more keyboard customization than gnome (about 5-9 years ago). But in my search for a mouseless [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_Window_Manager][DWM]] (desktop window manager), I stumbled upon [[http://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/][Ratpoison]], [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wmii][wmii]] and Stumpwm. At that time, one of my colleagues was using wmii and showed it to me and I was impressed. However, since Stumpwm is written in common-lisp, and I was trying to learn it at that time, I tried using it, and have never looked back. Stumpwm is a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager][tiling window manager]] (unlike KDE, gnome, etc which are [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacking_window_manager][stacking window managers]]). It allows me to have absolute control of where and how to place my windows, and all that without touching the mouse. But the feature I like the most in Stumpwm is to be able to bind keyboard shortcuts to applications (switch to a certain app, or start it if it's not already running and then switch to it). Agreed that recently KDE (and other DWMs) support this functionality, but they did not about 4+ years ago. And, just using this feature made me so much more productive, and gave me a adrenaline rush that I have never bothered looking at DWM advancements since; I have achieved DWM nirvana ;)

Vim and Emacs: I had been a (pure) vim guy for almost 5 years, when I switched to Emacs. The move was motivated largely because of common-lisp (emacs + [[http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/][slime]] is the best way to code in common-lisp) and the uber awesome [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] (which I use for note taking, reminders, organization, planning and almost everything). To some people, these might be simply editors, but people who use them know that they will change the way you think and do things. If you are a developer, you should definitely use them!

Vimperator: Being a web developer, browser is my "the" tool. I tend to use both [[http://www.google.com/chrome/][Chrome]] ([[http://www.chromium.org/][chromium]]) and firefox during development. But for development I simply cannot do without the firefox+vimperator setup because browsing is such an easy (nay, great!) experience. Not only do i not need to move my hands (from the keyboard) to open links (in same or background tabs), but I can even do cool stuff like record a macro and play it back over and over again. This makes automated testing super easy!

As Eric Raymond said in "How to Become a Hacker"

Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.

Similarly, going mouse-less is one way to learn something that will open the door to a wonderful new world. And if you believe me, let me tell you, the grass is certainly greener on this side of the wall :)

    - summary: This is a continuation of the "kill the rat" series, where I showcase my favorite productivity tool!
    - body:
Yesterday, I mentioned ***here (kill that rat)*** about how I am using different tools and techniques to go mouseless and improve not only my productivity, but also the way I think. After writing it, I felt that each of those tools deserved a more detailed description than just a mention. This would also allow me to show you some of the cool things that I am able to do with them, and how I do them. Maybe they will act as a better motivating factor for you to make that switch :)

Today I will talk about [[http://www.nongnu.org/stumpwm/][stumpwm]], the best (according to me) of them all. As a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_Window_Manager][DWM]] it is extremely minimal in terms of look-and-feel, but highly configurable. Since a picture is worth a 1000 words, I'll let the below screenshots do the talking of the look-and-feel of stumpwm:

I'm sure you would have noted that:
1. windows do not have any borders; there are no close/minimize buttons
2. all windows take up equal window space. tiling is a better word here, because every window is a tile. you can increase or decrease the size of a tile, and hence of the application that it contains
3. due to the tiling nature, you can arrange the tiles (extremely easily) in any manner that you want
4. the taskbar is at the top and is very minimal

My favorite tiling structure, when I am coding is:
- emacs: left top
- terminal: left bottom
- firefox: right
with this structure the only time I have to ever touch the mouse is when I want to browse through the DOM structure in firefox!

Enough about tiling, lets talk about some other features, and then we will move onto configuration. As mentioned ***previously (kill that rat)***, my favorite feature is "open-or-raise". What this means is that when you hit a (configured) key combination, stumpwm will try to switch to the (configured for that key combination) application if it is already running; if not, then stumpwm will first execute/start it and switch the focus to it. When I say "switch to", it does not mean that it will pull the app into the tile that is currently into focus, but will instead move focus to the tile which is hosting the application.

This is better explained with help of another feature called "groups". Groups is the same as the "virtual desktop" concept that linux has had for so many years (and windoZZZe still does not have it). Virtual desktops are an extremely convenient way to manage multiple applications. Let me explain this with an example. I generally have the following 4 groups (this predates my use of stumpwm):
1. coding: emacs + terminal + firefox(+vimperator)
2. email client
3. messenger windows
4. general browsing: firefox, rss-reader, etc

Coming back to open-or-raise. Lets say i am currently on group-2 and reading email. Then I can press super+e (super = the windoZZZe "start" key) and switch immediately to group-1 with focus in emacs. Similarly, I can press super+f once to go to firefox instance on group-1 and press again to go to instance on group-4. For comparison, imagine the other scenario (that most people use today):

1. if you are a mouse user, move your hand from keyboard to mouse, navigate to the correct position on the taskbar, click, assume you have multiple instances of the application running, then navigate mouse to correct instance, click
2. if you are a keyboard user, then press alt+tab (like 10000 times :p) to finally come to the correct application

On the other hand, on stumpwm it's just 1 (or few) click(s). And configuring the keyboard binding is as simple as putting the below lines in your ~/.stumpwmrc file

(defcommand emacs () () (run-or-raise "emacs" '(:class "Emacs")))
(define-key *top-map* (kbd "s-e") "emacs")

Don't get scared of the brackets. The above lines are simply defining a command "emacs" and assigning it to the "super+e" key.

Personally, a setup like this makes the DWM invisible and makes me focus on the (really) important things; making it a "best" technology :)

I think the best technologies disappear. -- Jack Dorsey

It is really awesome, and there's no turning back once you get used to it. Of course, there are a lot more things that you can configure. But I would rather urge you to give it a try. It's as easy as running this command

sudo apt-get install stumpwm

on Ubuntu (other linuxes should have similar commands), and re-logging in with stumpwm selected as your DWM.

Don't forget to share what your experience is. And don't feel shy to ask for help (there are a lot of good tutorials and documentation online, especially [[http://www.nongnu.org/stumpwm/manual/stumpwm.html][here]], [[http://www.mygooglest.com/fni/stumpwm.html][here]] and a sample (extremely detailed but well documented) stumpwmrc [[http://deftsp-dotfiles.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/.stumpwmrc][here]])!

    - summary: Yet another awesome tool in the "kill that rat" series of productivity tools!
    - body:
Continuing with ***this (kill that rat)*** and ***this (stumpwm)***, let me introduce yet another of my favorite tools to you: [[http://www.vimperator.org/vimperator][vimperator]]. Vimperator is essentially a [[http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/][firefox]] plugin, but it is so awesome that it takes web browsing to a whole different level. And I am not exaggerating it at all; allow me to present the case in front of you.

The most basic (but awesome, nonetheless) feature is mouseless browsing. Press the "f" key so that all links on the page get highlighted with a number.

***image (highlight)***

Now you can press the number of the link you want to open, and that link will be opened in the current tab. Instead do the same with "F" and the link will be opened in a new tab. Similarly, the following keys can be used for navigation
8. h, j, k, l: moving left, down, up, right (similar to vim) on the page
6. gt: switch to next tab
7. gT: switch to previous tab
1. o: enter URL and open in current tab
2. O: edit current URL and open page in current tab
3. t: enter URL to open page in a new tab
4. T: edit current URL and open page in new tab
5. b+<number>: switch to tab #number
9. f: find on page

Another feature that I use regularly (atleast 10-20 times in a single day) is dynamic bookmarks. I am sure that online search (google, bing, wikipedia, etc) is an extremely frequent usecase in any persons browsing session. Most browsers provide a dedicated search-bar next to the location bar. And also, this search-bar is customizable, that is the browser provides a dropdown of the various search engines that you want to search on. This is definitely more convenient than first going to the search engine page and then searching; you save 1 step. But:
1. see the above image again. Vimperator removes both the location bar and the search bar as well
2. more importantly, navigating the mouse to the search bar and optionally changing the search engine is not the best way to do it at all

So how do we solve this problem efficiently using vimperator? This is where dynamic bookmarks come in. Lets take an example of using the google search engine. You need to do this only the 1st time:
1. go to google.com and search for "golb.in"
2. press "a" to see a "bmark" command at the bottom of the page
3. edit the URL to look similar to
https://www.google.com/search?q=%s
4. leave a space after the URL and enter "-keyword google"
5. press enter

And you are done. Now every time you want to search something on google, simply press "t google <your search query>" and you will be taken to the corresponding google search page. You can do similarly with other search engines, and create bookmarks like "bing", "wiki", etc. Heck, this technique can be used on any website that gives you a search functionality. Who needs browser supported search engines anymore? Ain't that cool?

I hope this (and my previous ***post (kill that rat)*** on going mouseless) has convinced you to atleast give vimperator a try. If not, don't worry. I still have a few more, advanced but even more awesome, features of vimperator. I will leave them for the next post ;)

But I won't leave you before telling you that you can reach the locally available help via the ":help" and ":helpall" commands

If you did give vimperator a try, do let me know your experience using it, via comments. And don't feel shy or afraid to ask for help if you find it difficult

    - summary: Advanced, but even more awesome, features of vimperator -- the tool that takes web browsing to another level!
    - body:
Hello there. Welcome back! I hope you have already read my first post on vimperator ***here (vimperator-1)***, if not, I urge you to read that first and then come back here. Go on, I'll wait :)

Today I will show you some advanced, but even more awesome features of vimperator -- the tool that takes web browsing to another level! The first is "modes". If you have used the fantastic [[http://www.vim.org/][vim]] editor before, you will know what I am talking about; and you will feel very much at home with vimperator (in fact, I am sure you would have guessed that the name "vimperator" stems from "vim"). For those of you who have not used vim, worry not; that is why I am here, to help you out :)

Anyways, so vimperator has different modes of operation. The most commonly used are the "insert" and the "normal" modes. The "insert" mode is where the focus is inside some inputbox or textarea of a form (for example when you are filling up the username/password in a login form, or even when you are typing inside the search box on some website). In this mode your keyboard shortcuts like h, j, k, l, etc (see my previous post ***here (vimperator-1)*** for details) will NOT work. Instead whatever you type on the keyboard will get filled in the box.

As against this, the "normal" mode is where you really use the keyboard shortcuts to navigate on the page, or between tabs, etc. The easiest way to go from "normal" mode to "input" mode is
1. either press "f", and select the number corresponding to the input box you want to type into
2. or click with mouse inside the input box
3. or press "gi" to go to the first (or last visited) input box

Similarly, to go from "input" mode to "normal" mode is
1. either left-click your mouse anywhere on the page (except inside an input box)
2. press the "Esc" key on your keyboard

The next feature, which is my favorite, that I am going to show you is "macros". Again, if you have used a real editor (vim and/or emacs), then you know what editor macros are. Basically they are a recorded set of commands that you can repeat with just 1 key press. Understanding macros can make your life super simple! So lets say you want to repeat a set of tasks a few number of times; for example, you want to register 10 accounts on a website that you are developing/testing. Also lets say, for the sake of this discussion, that the registration page is quite long (has say 20 fields). However, for the testing accounts you would want to only have the username to be different (something like "test1", "test2", "test3", and so on), and all other fields to be the same. Lets also assume filling 1 form takes about 2 minutes -- that is 20 minutes for 10 accounts. So how do we do the same task in like 2.5 mins; or maybe 20 accounts in 3 mins?

The first thing you do, obviously, is to open the page ;). Now, before you start filling the form, press 'qa'. The key 'q' will start the recording and save it in a buffer 'a'. You should now see the word 'Recording' in your status bar (as shown below)

***image (recording)***

Then you fill up the form content. After finishing, press the 'q' key again, and the whole sequence (including form content) will be saved into the 'a' buffer. You should now see a message in the status bar like:

Recorded macro 'a'

Remember to NOT press the "submit" button of the form while the recording is still going on, because that will use the same username all the 10 (or 20) times, and will simply result in an error. After you have pressed 'q' for the second time (and completed the macro recording), you should press the submit button. Now that we have this macro recorded, we want to repeat it 10 times. For that all you need to do is to open the registration page, and press '@a'. The '@' key tells vimperator that we want to invoke a previously saved macro, and the 'a' tells the macro name. In fact this can be done in an even better way by saving the "page open" also inside the macro (using the "t <page-url>" command (see my previous post ***here (vimperator-1)***)); this is left as an excercise for the user ;)

The above was just 1 scenario where one can use macros. But once you know that you have this powerful tool at your disposal, the opportunities of using it are endless. I have even successfully used it for developer testing of web frontend (something similar to what selenium does).

Finally, let me show you some configurations that you can put in your ~/.vimperatorrc file, with the help of a snippet of my config file

set ds=yahoo

map <C-.> gt
map <C-,> gT
map <C-s> :sav

ia Pra Pradnyesh
ia Sa Sawant
ia sp spradnyesh

1. "set ds=yahoo" sets Yahoo! as my default search engine. so if i say "t <some space separated text>", then this is not a URL, and instead, vimperator will search for this text on the Yahoo! search engine
2. the "map" command maps a key combination to a particular command. For example, I personally find the "gt" and "gT" combos extremely unwieldy for changing tabs. So I have mapped the "control+." and "control+,", respectively, which are much more convenient for me. Similarly, "control+s" saves the page ;)
3. the "ia" command expands the shortform into the longform when the first is entered into some form input box. For example when I press "Pra" into an input box, it automatically gets expanded into "Pradnyesh". Ain't that neat?

I sincerely hope that I have been able to show you what a great tool vimperator is and how it can turn web-browsing into a completely different ball game. I also hope that you have enjoyed reading this as much as I have writing it.

Finally, as always, do share your experiences and don't feel shy/afraid to ask for help :)

ps: I have tried similar plugins for the chrome browser, but they don't come anywhere near to what vimperator can do.

    - summary: Continuing the "kill that rat" series with one more super-awesome productivity tool!
    - body:
Looks like I really have you hooked onto the concept of not only improving productivity, but changing the way you think by "killing the rat!" (see ***here (kill that rat)***, ***here (stumpwm)***, ***here (vimperator-1)*** and ***here (vimperator-2)*** for previous post on the "kill that rat" series). Good for both of us! For you because you will pave your way onto a completely different level, and for me because I am benefiting through this series too
1. improving my writing skills
2. writing/blogging improves cognitive skills (see ***here (to blog or not to blog)***)
3. teaching is the best form of learning

So lets continue the series and learn about the super-awesome [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] in [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/][emacs]]. If emacs was not as awesome as it is, but had just this 1 feature, even then it is worthwhile to undergo the steep learning curve and start using emacs. Is that claim a bit too far fetched? Not at all, allow me to explain.

In short org-mode = notes + todo + planner + reminders + tables (including calculator) + export (to html, pdf, tex, etc) + etc

Basically, if you have ever used a mind-mapping tool (if you have not, and are not on emacs yet, I would surely suggest that you try one out (see [[http://lifehacker.com/5188833/hive-five-five-best-mind-mapping-applications][here]]) before starting on the steep learning curve of emacs), then org-mode is everything that your (favorite) mind-mapping tool did not offer, and not all the bloat that you wanted it to not have.

Ok, enough round-about stories. Lets get to the real point with some concrete features:

1. Plain Text Files: org-mode uses plain text files to store all information, which means that
    a. you are never tied up to any proprietary format, and can move to some other tool if you wish
    b. you can version-control your data files (visit the git-week series ***here (git-1)***, ***here (git-2)***, ***here (git-3)***, ***here (git-4)*** and ***here (git-5)***)

2. Section-ify: it is super easy to split your content into sections, sub-sections, sub-sub-sections, and so on. The best part about splitting your content into sections is that you can collapse all sections except the one that you are interested in reading and/or editing right now. This is the same reason why people use mind-mapping tools; to be able to zoom into just 1 sub-part at a time and concentrate on it. Thus you can see the whole picture by zooming out, or concentrate on a small section by zooming in at whatever level you want to. Let me explain this with the following image:

***image***

As you can see, I am currently writing this very article in the golbin.org file. But all other sections, namely "backlog", "notes", etc and sub-sections, namely "wrote (no published)...", etc are all collapsed. Thus at this time, I am looking only at this article, and nothing else is distracting me.

3. Agendas: Each headline can be turned into a task, and you can assign a schedule (start date-time) and/or a deadline (end date-time) to it. Org-mode will then keep a track of it, and you will be able to see all of your todos in the agenda view (on a day/week/month level). This is really the killer feature of org-mode.

***image http://orgmode.org/img/agenda.jpg***

4. Clocking: They say

You cannot manage what you cannot measure. --F. John Reh

Well, we have been talking about improving productivity, but how can we do that if we don't measure it? Wouldn't it be great if we could know exactly how much time we are spending on every (non-trivial) activity? The clocking feature of org-mode allows one to do exactly that. All you have to do is to mention the task as a headline (doesn't matter what level it is at). Then you can simply take the cursor to that task and press 'C-c C-x C-i' to clock-in and 'C-c C-x C-o' to clock-out of the task. With practice it becomes second nature. And what's more org-mode even shows you a cool summary view
***image http://orgmode.org/img/clocking.jpg***

5. Tables: A lot of times we need to have some tabular data in our notes, but even our favorite note-taking (or mind-mapping) software does not allow us to do that; except org-mode that is ;). Org-mode allows not only creating and editing tables, but also allows us to import and export them from/to .csv and .tsv formats.
***image http://orgmode.org/img/table2.jpg***

6. Exporting: Org mode allows one to easily export notes into various formats like html, pdf, latex, etc. A lot of people even use it for blogging directly from within emacs.
***image http://orgmode.org/img/export.jpg***

I hope I have given you enough reasons to atleast give it a try and see how you feel about it. But then, as I had said previously, if you are not in a mood (or can't right now due to other constraints) to go through the steep learning curve that emacs has, you should atleast use a mind-mapping tool. It will allow you to organize your thoughts better!

Finally, as always, do share your experiences and don't feel shy/afraid to ask for help :)
