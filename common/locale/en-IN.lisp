originality-body=<h1>The Committment of Originality</h1><p>Content is king.* You've heard the saying. But what kind of content? Is some content not king (or queen)? Is there a standard for great, high quality, remarkable content? You bet.</p><p>We at Golbin believe that original, handcrafted, written-and-loved-and-tended-by-you content is not only the most enjoyable to write, but also the most useful for readers to discover, and the most likely to get spread to other people.</p><p>Even better, let's put a face on the word 'content.' On its own, 'content' is a broad, generic, vague term. What we've found works best for our Golbin writers is opinion content. First hand reviews. Recommendations. Storytelling. Experience sharing. As we said when we started the company, Golbin is an opportunity for you to share <em>your point of view</em>, your take on a specific topic.</p><p>This is a handshake, a thank you, and a reminder to keep writing original articles. Articles that no one else could have written better or more uniquely than we know you can. It also comes with extra tips, to save you from spending time and energy on a low-quality, non-original article that winds up getting removed. </p><h2>The best rules of thumb for creating original content are:</h2><ul><li>Write about topics that interest you. When you're interested and have an opinion, it's easier to make a great article.</li><li>Push yourself to create. Creation means building something from scratch. And it's extraordinarily rewarding when you do.</li><li>When you quote from or cite other sources on the web, link to them. Only quote small excerpts. Even ask in advance if you're not sure. And better yet -- follow it with your own unique perspective on that information.</li><li>Do the same for product recommendations. Even if you don't have first person experience with the product, you surely have an opinion about whether you wish you did, and what you might do if the item landed in your lap! </li><li>Achieve balance. If you handcurate and quote other sources, be sure to add plenty of your own original content to the article at the same time.</li><li>&quot;Duplicating content&quot; isn't a great practice, and if there's too much duplicated content, that means it's not unique to your article, right? It could get removed. If it's plagiarized (meaning, you use too much of someone else's content, or you don't cite even the smallest amount), your article will get removed for sure.</li><li>Try original, with a twist: Be the editor in chief of a conversation on your article. Even if you don't write it all yourself, moderating and adding context to other people's comments creates unique collaborative meaning. </li></ul><p>This is an agreement to create, craft, build, bake, innovate, write, opine, talk, storytell, review, recommend, and stand out from the crowd. That's the magic of Golbin. Thank you for being here.</p><p>By continuing to maintain and publish articles on Golbin, you are pledging to craft original, unique articles. We at Golbin are pledging to you in return that we will continue to support quality work and will help remove low-quality, aggressively non-original articles.</p>
tnc-body=<h3>Terms of Service</h3><div class='section'><p>What's Golbin? Golbin is the free (yes, free), simple tool that makes it easy for you to publish your interests online. You even earn money!. From authors and astronauts to marketers and musicians, to cat lovers and seahorse keepers and quiltmakers and video gamers and teachers and... well, everyone... anyone with something to say, share, promote and recommend is welcome on Golbin. All you need to do is agree to the below Terms of Service, which, as you'll see, generally cover: <ol><li>Our Zero Tolerance policy about Spamming</li><li>An easy list of Do's and Don'ts</li><li>Your usual legalese jibberjabber.</li><p>So, congratulations. You're participating in one of the realest, coolest, most powerful free publishing platforms online. We're thrilled to work with you. And now, the TOS proper...<p>The principals in these Terms do not change, though the specific enforcement of our content standards may change from time to time; you can always check in on the most current version here. By your continuing use of the service, you're agreeing to the terms that were in place when you joined the service. By continuing to use Golbin, you're agreeing to the terms in place each time you create new content.</p></div><div class='section'><h3>1. YES, I AGREE!</h3><p>By using Golbin's platform and community forums, you are agreeing to the following terms and conditions (&quot;Terms of Service&quot;) on this page, we well as the policies outlined in our <a href="/originality.html">Originality Pact </a>page that supplements our TOS.</p><p>These Terms apply to anyone who uses Golbin (the Service), from our StoryTellers, to people stopping by and using the social tools featured on Golbin pages.</p><p>We're in this together. The more you give, the more you get; and to protect our StoryTellers and the web at large against spammers or other abuse, we've laid out clear guidelines. Our goal is to treat every StoryTeller fairly and with respect, and to make sure this community is a fun, engaging, diverse, positive place.</p><p>We aim to support high-quality, original and useful lifestyle content that real readers will be glad to land on. So, in addition to enforcing our TOS, we reserve the right to unpublish stories that have shallow or lower-quality writing, as well as stories that point to other sites that have been flagged as low quality or spam.</p></div><div class='section'><h3>2. The big picture: Description of Service</h3><p>Golbin makes available a collection of resources to registered (free) account holders (StoryTellers), including hosting services (the &quot;Service&quot;) for our (&quot;StoryTellers&quot;) who wish to create their own customized &quot;Stories&quot; on our site. A web surfer can quickly explore Stories on topics of interest, allowing him or her to quickly find thoughtful, personal, and handbuilt collections of links to relevant online content.</p><p>If a user fails to follow these rules below, Golbin can discontinue their ability to use the Service entirely. In addition, we have the right to delete your account and corresponding stories without notice if we see evidence of clear abuse or other inappropriate activity.</p><p><b>Registering: </b>You agree that you are at least 18 years of age on the date that you registered with Golbin. If any information that you provide during registration is not accurate (or if Golbin has reasonable grounds to believe so), then as detailed further below under &quot;Termination,&quot; Golbin has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse to grant you further access to the Service.</p><p>You will be responsible for any activities that take place under your name and password, or that take place on or via any of your Stories. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or account, or any other breach of security, please cancel your Stories immediately. It is up to you to maintain the confidentiality of your password and account. Golbin is not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the provisions of these Terms.</p><p><b>Privacy: </b>(More to come on this below, too). You also understand and agree that as part of the Service, you may receive certain communications from Golbin, such as account creation confirmations, payment statements, service announcements, administrative messages and any of the opt-in Golbin newsletters. You will be able to opt out of most of these communications, but not others (such as ones concerning your account and your payments). We'll promise to keep notes from us at a minimum (we don't like crowded inboxes, either!). If you don't want to receive ANY messages from us, ever, you will need to cancel your account. Sorry.</p><p>And, of course, Golbin promises to never ever ever (did we mention ever?) rent or sell your personal information, and you will never receive email from a third party as a result of your relationship with us, unless we explicitly ask and you explicitly opt in to do so.</p><!--p>When becoming a StoryTellers, you have the ability to turn ON a feature called &quot;contact the StoryTellers&quot;--this function allows people to send emails to you, without seeing your email address. The feature starts turned off, to protect you. You have the right to be contacted by readers with questions or comments. You also have the right not to. It's up to you to manage any email you get from your readers; Golbin cannot mediate email disputes that happen in your personal inbox.</p--></div><div class='section'><h3>3. The Rules</h3>Here are the big picture rules. Please remember that Golbin reserves the right to cancel your account if we suspect that you're spamming, sharing illegal content, abusing or maligning another community member or individual, or any other activities that don't fit the spirit of the site. We promise not to do this without fair cause. By following the below rules, we're betting you'll be just fine.<ul><li>You are solely responsible for your conduct and any data, text, information, screen names, links, graphics, photos, profiles, audio and video clips, and links (&quot;Content&quot;) that you submit, post and display on your Story or via the Service.</li><li>You cannot Spam. We hate Spam. Everyone hates Spam. Meet our Zero Tolerance Policy: You cannot modify, adapt or hack the Golbin website, your own stories, or anyone else's stories. You also cannot use your Golbin stories or our platform to spam or attack others online, on the site or off. This includes such behaviour as automatically redirecting traffic from your stories to other pages, introducing viruses to the site, spamming bloggers, email spam to authors or others, and more. If our community reports you for this activity--even if your stories and actions just SMELL spammy, you'll likely have your account deleted.</li><li>You also cannot create spam stories (multiple stories that carry the same content, stories that are irrelevant to the topic, stories that are uncurated and lifted from other sites, Golbin accounts with several stories devoid of multiple modules of handpicked content, accounts trying to promote the same service on hundreds of matching stories, or anything the Golbin officials deem to be Spam). Period.</li><li>We run regular and periodic reviews of stories to enforce our policies, including (but not limited to): acting against known spam content, locking stories on topics we can't support, 'doorway' stories that exist solely to promote an affiliate program, and most recently we have also increased our systematic intolerance of aggressively duplicated (unoriginal) content, story spinning (yikes), and plagiarism. We aim to support high-quality, original and useful lifestyle content that real readers will be glad to land on. So, in addition to enforcing our TOS, we reserve the right to unpublish stories that have shallow or lower-quality writing, as well as stories that point to other sites that have been flagged as low quality or spam.</li><li>You must not abuse, harass, threaten, malign, flame or intimidate other StoryTellers, staff, others who use the Service, bloggers or others online. Nor may you upload, post or otherwise include any Content that is defamatory, libelous, tortuous, vulgar, obscene, invasive of privacy, racially or ethnically objectionable, hateful, promotes or provides instructional information about illegal activities, or promotes any act of cruelty to animals or certain vegetables.</li><li>You must not impersonate another StoryTellers or any official of Golbin. If you trick someone into thinking you're something you're not, we'll lock your account.</li><li>Thou shalt not create X-rated stories. Creating X-rated stories may result in having your story or entire account locked and/or deleted.</li><li>Your author bio pics MUST be G-rated. Using R or X-rated avatars may result in having your entire account deleted.</li><li>If Golbin Staff believes your story to be grossly miscategorized, they reserve the right to re-categorize your story right away or lock it.</li><li>You cannot create Stories or use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose, or to promote or make solicitations for any illegal or unauthorized activity.</li><li>You cannot use the Service to distribute, share or solicit Content belonging to third parties without proper authorization from the owner(s) of that Content. You must respect the proprietary and intellectual property rights of others (including trademark, copyright and trade secrecy) in creating your Story. Golbin is a fair harbor platform and can't endorse the content on our pages; if you have an issue with another user's content, please contact that individual directly first. Failing that, please send us a note, and we may be able to review or lock the story in question.</li><li>You must not, in the use of Golbin, violate any Federal, state or local laws. You must comply with all local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content.</li><li>The Golbin <b>Respect Everyone </b>Policy: You cannot abuse other authors, bloggers, organizations and individuals online and off. Wait, did we mention this one yet? Probably because we're serious. Abuse = flaming people in the Golbin forum, harming their stories for your own gain, publicly maligning other members of the community, emailing threatening notes to authors, and more. If our forum moderators or community report you for these activities, your stories could get locked or deleted.</li><li>You cannot transmit content in breach of a confidentiality or fiduciary obligation you may have.</li><li>We've said this already but it's worth saying again: You cannot attempt to automatically redirect surfers to other domains, mislead surfers of the origins of the Content contained in your Story, or use your Story as storage for remote loading or to a website outside of the Golbin website.</li><li>You may not develop restricted or password-only Stories, or hidden pages or images (those not linked to from another accessible page).</li><li>You cannot interfere with or disrupt the Service, or any servers or networks connected to the Service, or disobey any requirements, procedures, policies or regulations of networks connected to the Service.</li><li>You cannot collect or store personal data about other users, except that you may encourage surfers to contact you and you may, in return, contact them back.</li><li>You cannot promote &quot;get rich quick&quot; schemes, ebooks, videos or manuals on Golbin.</li><li>Golbin reserves the right to change our StoryRank algorithm at any time.</li><li><b>The end of spambait: </b>Some topics are just irresistible to spammers. These are topics that don't generally exist in the real world, that aren't particularly useful, and that are very profitable to people who spam. So, here's where we draw the line between junk and spam. There are topics we're just not going to let people write about. We wish we didn't have to do that, but it's the best plan available to remove the bad actors that want to take advantage, while keeping the site open for passionate people of all stripes. So the deal is: you can't build any content in these areas on Golbin. If you are interested in these areas, it's entirely possible you will bump into our filter, and if you do, we hope you'll just walk away, not try to be clever and get around it. Hey, there must be other things you're passionate about in this world. Why not make a story on that, and leave the online texasholdem4u pages out. Even better, we hope that 99% of you won't even know it's there.</li><li>If your story exists to send people to a site that offers illegal downloads of movies, games, or music, we will suspend it, and will probably suspend ALL your stories. It's a violation of the our policies. We understand that more options are becoming available to watch TV shows and movies online, some paid and some free. However, writing stories about this topic can be tricky. These stories are almost always flagged and locked by our community for appearing to be a violation of our TOS and laws. If you choose to create stories about free online media sources, please keep in mind: <ol><li>If we doubt your resource, or if your story is reported as spam, we may end up locking your story, possibly for good.</li><li>If you actively spam, regardless of your topic, your story will probably be locked for good.</li><li>The most successful stories revolve around not-found-anywhere-else content. There are plenty of great ways to uses links as resources, and if your story has no original content, it could get flagged or locked.</li></ol></li></ul><p><strong>Even further clarification of our Terms of Service for those that need it to be clarified: </strong><ol><li>If you make a story filled with repetitive language designed to bait the search engines, we'll probably delete it. We are looking for useful, updated material that is written by a person, for a person.</li><li>If you make lots and lots of cookie cutter stories, each one mirroring the next, we will probably delete them. See #1.</li><li>Hosting content used without permission, copied and pasted stories, and/or uncredited images and language is against our TOS. For best results, just be you.</li></ol></p></div><div class='section'><h3>4. The content: who owns it?</h3><p>As a StoryTellers, you will be able to incorporate various forms of Content into your Stories. Golbin does not claim ownership of the Content you place on your Story. The Content will be owned by you or a third party from whom you got permission to post the content. By placing Content on your Story, however, you grant Golbin a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license, for as long as your Story is displayed on Golbin, to reproduce, display, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting your Story on Golbin. Golbin may preserve and store Content, and may also disclose Content if required to do so by law or if Golbin believes in good faith that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: <ul><li>comply with legal process (e.g., subpoenas); </li><li>enforce these Terms of Service; </li><li>respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties; or </li><li>protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Golbin, its users and the public.</li></ul></p><p>The StoryTellers, and not Golbin, will be fully responsible for all Content that is uploaded, posted, transmitted or otherwise made available by the StoryTellers on his or her Story. Golbin cannot guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. Golbin does not pre-screen Content, but will have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse or remove any Content in a Story for any reason, including Content that may violate these Terms, or that is otherwise objectionable. Golbin also cannot take responsibility for anything that your surfers may do in reliance on the Content you post in your Story. Bottom line: put it on your Story, you're responsible.</p><p></div><div class='section'><h3>5. About payments</h3>Golbin works on a 70-30 revenue sharing basis; that is you, as the author, get 70% of the income generated by your stories, and Golbin will keep 30% to recover costs. By registering for Golbin as a author, you are appointing Golbin as your agent to handle all Service transactions.</p><p>It's entirely possible that things will occur that will make it, in Golbin's sole discretion, impossible to maintain the structure described in this document. Hey, we're a startup, and we've taken zero venture capital. We may, for example, have to change the percentages or details of the Service. We agree that we will not make any financial changes retroactively. Any changes will be for future payments. If we do need to change any significant terms, we will notify you by email before any change occurs. At that point, you will have the option of removing your Story from the Service if you choose to stop working with the Service under the new structure.</p><p>The Service earns its income via display ads that we feature on your stories. Please note that per our partnership with Google AdSense, if they ask us to remove ads or lock a story that is promoting illegal activity or featuring content that violates our agreement with them, we will act to lock your story from view and will always let you know when we do. Furthermore, Google AdSense determines the type of ads that show up on stories, based on the content and tags you have put on the page. They may also turn on &quot;interest-based advertising&quot; as part of the AdSense program, which is a system that attempts to increase relevance of ads for your readers, based on other ads they've clicked in the AdSense network. As per Google: &quot;Interest-based advertising will allow advertisers to show ads based on a user's previous interactions with them, such as visits to advertiser website and also to reach users based on their interests (e.g. &quot;sports enthusiast&quot;). To develop interest categories, we will recognize the types of web pages users visit throughout the Google content network. As an example, if they visit a number of sports pages, we will add them to the &quot;sports enthusiast&quot; interest category.&quot;</p><p>Currently we support payment via NEFT only in India, and via PayPal elsewhere. If you are outside India, and if you cannot receive money via PayPal, then we cannot pay you. Sorry.</p><p><b>Forfeiture of Earnings: </b>There are several ways in which you may lose your reported Earnings. These include, without limitation, the following: </p><ul><li>If you in any way violate or otherwise breach these Terms of Service;</li><li>If you engage in any activity intended to, or the result of which could or would, defraud Golbin or any third party, including, without limitation, with respect to any advertising activity arising on your Story, taking any action (or authorizing any third party to take any action) to inflate or otherwise manipulate traffic or click-through counts from your Story to participating advertisers or merchants, or otherwise attempting, in Golbin's good faith judgment, to simulate artificially the behavior or activity of an individual live Web user.</li><li>If you list items for sale via an affiliate partner (like eBay or Amazon) just to buy from them yourself and otherwise inflate your commissions;</li><li>It's important to note that if you go more than twelve months without reaching a payout, we'll assume you've abandoned your account and that money will be returned to our system and applied to our overhead and our charity fund.</li></ul><p>In the event of any downtime of the site, or any technical problem the site may (heaven forfend!) undergo, Golbin, as a free service, is not responsible for compensating authors for perceived loss of earning potential. We historically go out of our way to make it up to authors, in your favor, when there is a demonstrable and specific and individual earning glitch. But by default we cannot treat earning potential the same as actual recorded earnings.</p><p>By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Golbin will not be responsible for, and will not be obligated in any manner to repay you for, any lost earnings.</p></div><div class='section'><h3>6. Resale of service</h3><p>You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service, other than through the display and use of your story. This means you agree not to hijack content from other stories, plagiarize, set up false accounts, spam or hack stories, duplicate stories on other services, or exploit other users by selling them false information or services about Golbin.</p><p><strong>Prohibited uses: </strong>Golbin is designed to permit users to share information that is important to them. It's built around individuals and their passions. You're not permitted to spam Golbin to create stories for hire in order to generate web traffic and SEO rankings. It is fine to use Golbin to create stories about your business or even for your clients, but you may not cross the line and start creating pages in bulk.</p><p></div><div class='section'><h3>7. Golbin can modify or discontinue the service</h3>Golbin reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice, without liability to you or any third party.</p></div><div class='section'><h3>8. External software</h3><p>You may not use external services, software or networks to automatically create or to augment your creation of stories.</p></div><div class='section'><h3>9. Golbin can terminate your use of the service</h3><p>Oooo, scary. But true. Golbin, in its sole discretion, may terminate your password, account or use of or access to the Service, and remove and discard any Story, for any reason. Some of the more likely reasons for termination are inaccurate information in the registration form, or harassment of other StoryTellers (this is a BIG no no), bloggers and other individuals online. More reasons include hacking Stories or the Service, automatically redirecting story traffic to another site, spamming people on and off the site, illegal transactions via Golbin, and otherwise acting in violation of the terms or the spirit of these Terms of Service or other policies making an StoryTellers a fine, upstanding member of the Golbin community. If Golbin terminates your use of the Service, then your Story may be immediately taken down, and your Golbin Earnings Account may be closed. In this event, Golbin will not be responsible to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.</p></div><div class='section'><h3>10. Golbin proprietary rights</h3><p>You acknowledge and agree that the Service and any necessary software used in connection with the Service (&quot;Software&quot;) contain proprietary and confidential information that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws.</p></div><div class='section'><h3>11.

Golbin expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Golbin makes no warranty that the service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free (gremlins happen!), or that the quality of any products, services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by you through the service will meet your expectations, or that any errors in the software will be corrected. If you've got a really big beef with a bug or a technicality, and you don't like the way Golbin is being run, we hope you'll share your feedback with our team before quitting the service.</p></div><div class='section'><h3>12. Limitation of liability</h3><p>You expressly understand and agree that Golbin will not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from the use or the inability to use the Service, unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data, statements or conduct of any third party on the Service, or any other matter relating to the Service. Wow was that a long sentence.</p></div><div class='section'><h3>13. Miscellaneous, but important, terms</h3><p>These Terms of Service and the relationship between you and Golbin will be governed by the laws of the State of Maharashtra, India without regard to its conflict of law provisions. The failure of Golbin to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms of Service, together with any other agreements incorporated by reference in these Terms of Service or entered into between you and Golbin in connection with your registration as a StoryTellers, constitute the entire agreement between you and Golbin and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Golbin. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or other Golbin services, third-party content or third-party software. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p></div><div class='section'><h3>14. Dispute resolution</h3><p>By accepting these Terms of Service, you acknowledge that we're all in this together. If at any point, you feel as though you have a dispute with Golbin, you agree to abide by our dispute resolution principles.<ol><li>You agree to read our FAQ file to see if your question has been previously answered.</li><li>If that doesn't work, you agree to <a href="http://ed.golbin.com/feedback.html">contact us</a>, outlining your problem.</li><!--li>If, after two weeks, you haven't found a satisfactory resolution, you agree to submit to binding arbitration, to be conducted by a member of the American Arbitration Association, in New York, at your expense. If you win, we will pay the arbitration expenses and your reasonable attorney's fees. If we win, you agree to do the same for us.</li--><li>By accepting these terms, you waive your right to go to court and you explicitly waive your right to participate in a class action lawsuit.</li></ol>Golbin is one of many ways you can post information online, and if you find any of these conditions unacceptable, we will totally understand (though our feelings will be hurt) if you choose to use a different service.</p></div><div class='section'><h3>15. Trademarks</h3><p>The following are trademarks of Golbin LLP:<ul><li>Golbin</li></ul></p></div><div class='section'><h3>16. Good Practice</h3><p>We take our terms of service seriously, and we work to be good internet citizens. That means that if you use Golbin to help you workaround the rules of Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter or other services, we'll consider that a violation of our TOS and will take action, possibly including locking your stories or deleting your account.</p><p>Don't spam other networks or other sites. Don't use Golbin as a veiling tool when you could use these services in the way they're intended. Pushing your affiliate links onto other services doesn't work and it's selfish, too, hurting the rest of us.</p><p>On the other hand, YES, please use Golbin when you have something personal and unique to say. We like that and so do the other services that you and the rest of the StoryTellers use.<p>WHEW! You made it. You read the whole Golbin Terms of Service. Please let us know <a href="http://ed.golbin.com/feedback.html">how we can do better</a>. And thanks!</p><p>Creating original stories is a requirement on Golbin. The <a href="http://ed.golbin.com/originality.html">Scroll of Originality</a>is an addendum to our Terms of Service.</p><p>We at Golbin believe that original, handcrafted, written-and-loved-and-tended-by-you content is not only the most enjoyable to write, but also the most useful for readers to discover, and the most likely to get spread to other people.</p><p>Even better, let's put a face on the word 'content.' On its own, 'content' is a broad, generic, vague term. What we've found works best for our Golbin writers is opinion content. First hand reviews. Recommendations. Storytelling. Experience sharing. As we said when we started the company, Golbin is an opportunity for you to share your point of view, your take on a specific topic.</p><p>This is a handshake, a thank you, and a reminder to keep writing original stories. Stories that no one else could have written better or more uniquely than we know you can. It also comes with extra tips, to save you from spending time and energy on a low-quality, non-original story that winds up getting removed.</p><p>Read the rest of the <a href="http://golbin.com/originalitypact">Scroll of Originality</a>.</p><p>We run regular and periodic reviews of stories to enforce our policies, including acting against spam, locking stories on topics we can't support, locking low-quality stories, and most recently we have increased our systematic intolerance of duplicated content and plagiarism. We reserve the right to take down content that violates our Terms of Service and editorial standards, without warning.</p></div>
faq-body=<div class="section"><h2>Brand new to Golbin?</h2><p>Welcome!</p><p>Golbin is the popular publishing platform and community that makes it easy for you to create &quot;stories&quot; online. Stories are pages, kind of like flyers or signposts or overview articles, that gather everything you know about your topic of interest--and snap it all into focus. Like the story of a camera, your perspective on something. (You're looking at a story right now).</p><p>It's a super-simple, fun and powerful way to share your interests, build your online identity and credibility, and connect with new readers and friends. It's all free, and you could even earn money for yourself.</p><p>Because there's so much you can DO with Golbin, we know it can get a little overwhelming when you're brand new and still poking around. So many different ways to make a page, different themes and colors and ... what was that about money?</p><p>So, while there's a ton more to know (and you'll figure it out over time, never fear) we wanted to put together this overview page for you. It's got some vocabulary, some examples, and a basic lowdown on what you can expect from Golbin. If you look at the tabs up top, you'll see there's a lot more info here too, like our Terms of Service, a FAQ and more. No need to read it all, but good to reference back to over time.</p><p>I hope you'll feel comfortable poking around and exploring, and when you're ready, try making a &quot;story&quot; of your own.</p><p>Thanks for visiting.</p></div><div class="section"><h2>What kinds of stories can you make?</h2><h3>All kinds. Every kind.</h3><p>Not sure what you can make a story about? You could make an About Me story (well, about you). Or a review story. Or a story about your blog, to help point traffic to it. Or a story about your art. Or your eBay or Etsy or Zazzle or CafePress shop. Or about your hobby. Or your dogs. Or your hometown. Or your favorite books or movies or video games.</p><p>Here are a few more places to get ideas, and a few tips for getting started:</p></div><div class="section"><h2>What's this about money? A real world example.</h2><h3>and how does that work?</h3><a class="right" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hollyclark/596587085/" title="Cupcakes are fun to make. by OrangeCounty_Girl, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1093/596587085_ac515f7aa8.jpg" width="236" height="250" alt="Cupcakes are fun to make."></a><b>Let's look at a example scenario.</b><p>Robin is a very busy, very creative woman. She was helping plan her son's wedding and put together "this story all about the mother-son dance songs" they were considering, and then asked her friends to comment on their favorites. She added YouTube music videos of some of the songs, a list of her top contenders, an open comments section for other moms to post the songs they danced to with their sons.</p><p>So now, if you land on her story and you like one of the contextual Google ads we've matched to her page and you either buy or click, Robin earns money. (This page was entirely free for her to make, remember).</p><p>She's also made about 300 other stories on things like "Best Panini Sandwich Recipes" and "Bunches of Cute Birthday Cupcakes".</p><p>In fact, Robin has gotten so good at making recommendation stories about the stuff she knows and loves that she's one of our very top earners, making thousands of dollars on Golbin.</p><p>So that's how it works. Cool, huh?</p><p></div>
